  "summary": "The code above is a React component that renders a \"Coming Soon\" message. The component is imported from a file located at \"components/ComingSoon\". The purpose of this code is to provide a placeholder for a future feature or section of the website that is currently under development. \n\nThis component is likely to be used in the larger project as a way to inform users that a particular section of the website is not yet available. For example, if the website is a zoo website, this component may be used to indicate that a new exhibit or feature is coming soon. \n\nThe code is relatively simple. It defines a functional component called \"Press\" that returns a div containing the \"ComingSoon\" component. The \"ComingSoon\" component is likely to be a simple message or graphic that indicates that the feature is not yet available. \n\nHere is an example of how this component might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport Press from \"components/Press\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo Website</h1>\n      <Press />\n      <p>Check back soon for updates!</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"Press\" component is used to indicate that a particular section of the website is not yet available. The message is displayed between the heading and the paragraph, providing a clear indication to the user that the website is still under development. \n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and effective way to indicate that a particular feature or section of the website is not yet available. It is likely to be used in a larger project as a way to manage user expectations and provide a clear indication of what is coming soon.",
