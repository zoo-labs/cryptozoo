  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `InfoSection` that renders a section of the Zoo project's website. The section contains information about the project's features and benefits, presented as a list of cards. Each card contains an icon, a title, and a description of a specific feature. \n\nThe `utils` array contains an object for each feature, with properties for the feature's title, description, and icon. The `InfoSection` component maps over this array to render a card for each feature. The icon is displayed as an image, and the title and description are displayed as text. \n\nThe `InfoSection` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, it could be included in a landing page or a features page to provide an overview of the project's capabilities. \n\nHere is an example of how the `InfoSection` component could be used in a landing page:\n\n```\nimport InfoSection from './components/InfoSection';\n\nconst LandingPage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <header>\n        {/* header content */}\n      </header>\n      <main>\n        <InfoSection />\n        {/* more content */}\n      </main>\n      <footer>\n        {/* footer content */}\n      </footer>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default LandingPage;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `InfoSection` component is imported from a file located in the `components` directory. It is then included in the `main` section of the landing page, along with other content. \n\nOverall, the `InfoSection` component provides a simple and reusable way to display information about the Zoo project's features. By encapsulating the feature cards in a component, the code is easier to read, maintain, and reuse.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `utils` array?\n   \n   The `utils` array contains objects that represent different features of the Zoo project, such as \"Stability Tax\" and \"Mint New Animals\". Each object has a title, description, and icon associated with it.\n\n2. What is the `InfoSection` component responsible for?\n   \n   The `InfoSection` component is responsible for rendering a section of the Zoo website that displays information about the project's features. It uses the `utils` array to generate a list of feature descriptions with icons.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `Image` and `React` imports at the beginning of the code?\n   \n   The `Image` import is used to display images on the website, while the `React` import is necessary for defining React components. However, neither of these imports are actually used in the `InfoSection` component itself.",
