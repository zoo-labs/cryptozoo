  "summary": "The `ZooNewsSection` component is a React component that renders a section of the Zoo website dedicated to news about the project. The component imports the `React` and `useEffect` modules from the `react` package, as well as the `Image` component from the `next/image` package. It also imports an `fadeInOnScroll` function from an `animation` module located in a different part of the project.\n\nThe component renders a section element with the class name `ZooNews`. The section contains two child elements: a div with the class name `pt-16 pb-16 px-6 lg:max-w-7xl lg:mx-auto`, and a div with the class name `flex flex-col items-center max-w-xl lg:max-h-[494px] mx-auto lg:flex-row lg:items-stretch lg:max-w-5xl`.\n\nThe first child div contains two child elements: a div with the class name `flex items-center text-center flex-col`, and a paragraph element. The first child div contains a heading element with the text \"ZOO News\" and a paragraph element with a description of the news content.\n\nThe second child div contains two child elements: an `Image` component and a div with the class name `flex flex-col justify-center w-full lg:basis-1/2 bg-deep-gray rounded-r-2xl lg:-ml-2 -mt-3 lg:-mt-0`. The `Image` component displays an SVG image of the Zoo logo. The second child div contains a div with the class name `max-w-sm mx-auto py-8 lg:py-0 px-4 lg:px-0`, which contains a heading element, a paragraph element, and a link to a blog post.\n\nThe `ZooNewsSection` component does not use the `fadeInOnScroll` function, which is commented out. The component exports itself as the default export of the module.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger Zoo project to display news content to users. It is a reusable component that can be included in other pages or components that need to display news content. Developers can customize the content of the component by changing the text and images displayed. For example, they can replace the Zoo logo with a different image, or change the text of the heading and paragraph elements to reflect different news content.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `fadeInOnScroll` function and why is it commented out?\n- The `fadeInOnScroll` function is an animation function that fades in an element on scroll. It is likely commented out because it is not currently being used or may have caused issues with the component's rendering.\n\n2. What is the `ZooNewsSection` component responsible for rendering?\n- The `ZooNewsSection` component renders a section of the Zoo website that displays news and information about the company's NFTs, conservation efforts, and educational resources.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Image` component and what props are being passed to it?\n- The `Image` component is being used to display an SVG image of the Zoo logo. The `src`, `width`, `height`, `alt`, and `objectFit` props are being passed to it to specify the image source, dimensions, accessibility text, and how the image should be scaled to fit its container.",
