  "summary": "The code defines a React component called FaqSection that renders a section of frequently asked questions (FAQs) for a project called ZOO. The component imports the React library and the Link component from the Next.js library. It also imports an animation function called fadeInOnScroll from an external module called \"animation\".\n\nThe FaqSection component returns a section element with an id of \"faqs\". The section contains a div element with a class of \"px-6 py-20 mx-auto max-w-7xl\" that sets some padding, margin, and maximum width styles. Inside this div, there is an h2 element that displays the title \"Game FAQ\" and a description of the game. The section also contains a flex container with four flex items, each containing a question and an answer about the game.\n\nThe first question asks \"What is ZOO?\" and the answer describes the project as a liquidity protocol that bridges tokens and NFTs at the intersection of DeFi and gaming. It explains that each NFT yields the native currency $ZOO and is collateralized by $ZOO, which appreciates over time based on rarity, age, and playing the game.\n\nThe second question asks \"What are the Key Features in ZOO?\" and the answer lists some of the key features, including growing and breeding animals, and an upcoming AR app that will allow players to interact with their NFTs in augmented reality.\n\nThe third question asks \"What is the $ZOO token?\" and the answer explains that it is the native currency in the game that allows token holders to play, invest, use the NFT marketplace, and be part of the game.\n\nThe fourth question asks \"How Do I Get Started?\" and the answer explains that players can access the game through the DApp or ZOO Labs' official website.\n\nThe fifth question asks \"How do I buy $ZOO?\" and the answer provides a link to a presentation that explains how to buy the token.\n\nThe section ends with a call-to-action button that links to a page with more FAQs.\n\nOverall, the FaqSection component provides a user-friendly way for players to learn about the ZOO project and its features. It can be used as part of a larger website or application that promotes the game and its community.",
