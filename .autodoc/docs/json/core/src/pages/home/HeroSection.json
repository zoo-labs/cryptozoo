  "summary": "The `HeroSection` component is a React component that renders a hero section for the zoo project. The hero section is the first section of the website that users see when they visit the website. The hero section contains a video background and a set of slides that display different animals and their information. The component uses the `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` hooks from React to manage the state of the component and to interact with the DOM.\n\nThe `slides` array contains an array of objects that represent the different animals that are displayed in the hero section. Each object contains information about the animal, such as its title, video, price, type, and URI. The `activeSlideIndex` state variable is used to keep track of the currently active slide.\n\nThe `videoRef` and `videoCurrent` variables are used to reference the video element in the DOM and to interact with it. The `useEffect` hook is used to add an event listener to the video element that listens for the `timeupdate` event. When the `timeupdate` event is fired, the `handleVideoUpdate` function is called, which updates the `activeSlideIndex` state variable based on the current time of the video.\n\nThe `return` statement of the component renders the hero section. The hero section contains a `div` element that contains the video background and the slides. The `slides` array is mapped over to render each slide. The `activeSlideIndex` state variable is used to determine which slide is currently active. The `video` element is used to render the video background. The `Link` component from the `next/link` library is used to create a link to the animal's URI. The `button` element is used to display the animal's information and to allow users to navigate to the animal's page.\n\nOverall, the `HeroSection` component is an important part of the zoo project as it is the first section of the website that users see when they visit the website. The component provides users with an engaging and interactive experience that showcases the different animals that are available at the zoo.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `HeroSection` component?\n- The `HeroSection` component is responsible for rendering a hero section with a video background and slides containing information about different animals and their types.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `handleVideoUpdate` function?\n- The `handleVideoUpdate` function is responsible for updating the active slide index based on the current time of the video. It uses a switch statement to determine the active slide index based on the time.\n\n3. What external libraries or modules are being used in this code?\n- The code is importing the `React` library, as well as the `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef` hooks from React. It is also importing the `Link` component from the `next/link` module. Additionally, it is importing the `capitalize` function from a `functions/format` module and the `fadeInFromLeft` and `fadeInOnScroll` animations from an `animation` module.",
