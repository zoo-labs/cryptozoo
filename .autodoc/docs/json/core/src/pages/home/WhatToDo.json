  "summary": "The code above is a React component that renders a section of a web page for the Zoo project. The purpose of this component is to display a list of utilities that can be performed with the Zoo NFTs. The component is called WhatToDo and it is imported from the file located at `zoo`.\n\nThe component imports three modules: Image, Link, and React. The Image module is imported from the Next.js library and is used to display an arrow icon. The Link module is also imported from Next.js and is used to create links to external resources. The React module is imported to enable the use of React components.\n\nThe component defines an array of objects called utilities. Each object represents a utility that can be performed with the Zoo NFTs. Each object has a title and a link property. The title property is a string that describes the utility, while the link property is a URL that points to a resource that provides more information about the utility.\n\nThe component then renders a section of the web page that displays the list of utilities. The section contains a heading that describes the purpose of the list and a paragraph that provides additional information. The list of utilities is displayed as a grid of boxes, each containing the title of a utility and an arrow icon that links to the resource that provides more information about the utility.\n\nFinally, the component renders a section of the web page that displays an image of an egg and a button that links to a page where users can start collecting NFTs. The purpose of this section is to encourage users to start using the Zoo NFTs.\n\nOverall, this component provides a high-level overview of the utilities that can be performed with the Zoo NFTs and encourages users to start collecting them. It is a useful component for the Zoo project as it provides a clear and concise summary of the project's features and benefits.",
