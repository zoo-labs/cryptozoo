  "summary": "The `JoinZooSection` component is a React component that renders a section of the Zoo project's website. The purpose of this section is to encourage users to follow Zoo on various social media platforms. The component imports the `React` library, as well as the `Image` component from the `next/image` library, and two custom icon components (`InstagramIcon` and `TwitterIcon`) from the `components/Icons` directory.\n\nThe component returns a section element with a purple background color and an ID of \"newsletter\". Within this section, there is a container element with a maximum width of 7xl (a custom tailwindcss class) that contains a heading, a paragraph, and a series of links to social media platforms. The heading encourages users to \"Join the ZOO family!\", while the paragraph instructs users to follow Zoo on social media. The links are represented as images, with each image wrapped in an anchor tag that links to the corresponding social media platform. The images are sourced from the `/img` directory and have a width and height of 32 pixels.\n\nThe component also contains a commented-out form element that would allow users to submit their email address to join the Zoo newsletter. However, this form is not currently being used and is therefore commented out.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger Zoo project to encourage users to follow Zoo on social media and stay up-to-date with the latest news and updates. It can be easily added to any page that requires a call-to-action for social media follows. For example, it could be added to the footer of the Zoo website to encourage users to follow Zoo on social media from any page. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nimport JoinZooSection from \"components/JoinZooSection\";\n\nconst HomePage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <JoinZooSection />\n      {/* other content */}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```",
