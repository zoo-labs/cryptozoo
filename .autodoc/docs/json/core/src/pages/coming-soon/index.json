  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `ComingSoon` that displays a \"Coming Soon\" message and a link to the homepage. The component imports the `React` and `useEffect` modules from the `react` package, as well as the `Link` component from the `next/link` package. It also imports an `fadeInOnScroll` function from an `animation` module.\n\nThe `ComingSoon` component renders a `div` element with two child elements: a `div` element and a `p` element. The `div` element has the class `max-w-7xl mx-auto py-20 px-4` and contains a child `div` element with the classes `flex`, `flex-col`, `items-center`, and `justify-center`, as well as a `ref` attribute set to a `comingSoonRef` object. The `comingSoonRef` object is created using the `useRef` hook from the `React` module.\n\nThe child `div` element contains two child elements: an `h1` element and a `p` element. The `h1` element has the classes `text-4xl`, `lg:text-[44px]`, `leading-[3rem]`, `lg:leading-4`, `font-bold`, and `mb-8`, and displays the text \"Coming Soon\". The `p` element contains a `Link` component that displays a link to the homepage.\n\nThe `useEffect` hook is used to call the `fadeInOnScroll` function with the `comingSoonRef.current` object as an argument. This causes the `comingSoonRef` element to fade in when it is scrolled into view.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display a \"Coming Soon\" message and a link to the homepage. It also demonstrates how to use the `useRef` and `useEffect` hooks in a React component, as well as how to import and use external modules. An example usage of this component might look like:\n\n```\nimport ComingSoon from \"./ComingSoon\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ComingSoon />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `fadeInOnScroll` function imported from \"animation\"?\n- The `fadeInOnScroll` function is used to animate the `comingSoonRef` element when it is scrolled into view.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `comingSoonRef` variable being assigned to `React.useRef()`?\n- The `comingSoonRef` variable is being used to reference the `div` element that contains the \"Coming Soon\" text and the link to the homepage. This allows the `fadeInOnScroll` function to target and animate this specific element.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this component?\n- The `useEffect` hook is used to call the `fadeInOnScroll` function once when the component mounts, which sets up the animation for the `comingSoonRef` element.",
