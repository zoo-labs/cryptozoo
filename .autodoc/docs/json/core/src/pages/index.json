  "summary": "This code is a React component that serves as the main dashboard for the Zoo project. It imports several dependencies, including React, nanoid from the Redux Toolkit, GetStaticProps from Next.js, Head from Next.js, loadTranslation from the entities file, Home component, and HomeLayout component. \n\nThe code exports a function called getStaticProps that is used to fetch data at build time. This function takes a locale parameter and generates a unique sessionId using nanoid. It then calls the loadTranslation function from the entities file, passing in the locale, sessionId, and a boolean indicating whether the environment is in production. The messages returned from this function are spread into an object and returned as props.\n\nThe default export of the file is a React component called Dashboard. This component renders a Head component from Next.js, which sets the title and meta description of the page. It also renders a Home component, which is the main content of the dashboard. Finally, the code sets the Layout property of the Dashboard component to the HomeLayout component.\n\nThis code is used to generate the main dashboard page of the Zoo project. The getStaticProps function is used to fetch translation messages at build time, which are then passed as props to the Dashboard component. The Dashboard component renders the main content of the dashboard, including the Home component and the Head component. The HomeLayout component is used to provide a consistent layout for the dashboard. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport Dashboard from \"./path/to/dashboard\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Dashboard />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
