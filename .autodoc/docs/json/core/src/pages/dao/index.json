  "summary": "The `Voting` component is a React component that renders a page for displaying and interacting with proposals in a DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). The component imports various dependencies, including `ProposalsTable` (a custom component for rendering a table of proposals), `useSelector` (a hook for accessing the Redux store), and several UI components from the Material-UI library.\n\nThe component defines several state variables using the `useState` hook, including `proposalState` (which represents the current state of proposals being displayed), `proposalType` (which represents the type of proposals being displayed), and `_proposals` (which represents the list of proposals being displayed). The component also defines a `getAllProposals` function using the `useGetAllProposals` hook, which retrieves all proposals from the DAO.\n\nThe component renders a page with two main sections: a sidebar and a main content area. The sidebar contains links to other pages in the DAO, while the main content area displays a table of proposals and various filtering options. The table of proposals is rendered using the `ProposalsTable` component, which takes in the list of proposals as a prop and filters them based on the current state and type.\n\nThe component also includes several event handlers for updating the state variables based on user input. For example, the `setProposalState` function is called when the user selects a new proposal state from a dropdown menu, and the `setProposalType` function is called when the user selects a new proposal type from a different dropdown menu. The component also includes a button for refreshing the list of proposals, which calls the `getAllProposals` function and displays a success message using the `addPopup` function.\n\nOverall, the `Voting` component provides a user-friendly interface for browsing and interacting with proposals in a DAO. By allowing users to filter proposals by state and type, the component makes it easy to find and participate in relevant proposals. The component could be used as part of a larger project for managing a DAO, alongside other components for creating and voting on proposals.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code is for a project called \"zoo\" and it appears to be related to a DAO voting system. It imports various components and hooks, sets up state variables, and renders a UI for displaying proposals and allowing users to filter and refresh them.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external libraries and dependencies, including Next.js, React, Redux, MUI, and various custom hooks and components.\n\n3. What is the significance of the commented-out code and why was it commented out?\n- The commented-out code appears to be an alternative way of rendering the proposal filtering options, using a different type of select element. It was likely commented out because the MUI select element was chosen as the preferred option instead.",
