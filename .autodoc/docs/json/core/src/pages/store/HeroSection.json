  "summary": "The `HeroSection` component is a React component that renders a search bar and links to the shopping cart and checkout pages of an online store. The component imports the `Link` component from the Next.js library and the `useAppSelector` hook and `CartItem` type from the project's state management and type definitions, respectively.\n\nThe `HeroSection` component uses the `useAppSelector` hook to retrieve the `CartItems` array from the project's Redux store. This array contains the items that the user has added to their shopping cart. The component then renders a search bar and two links. The search bar allows the user to search for products in the store. The first link leads to the shopping cart page and displays the number of items in the cart. The number of items is obtained from the `CartItems` array. The second link leads to the checkout page.\n\nThe component uses Tailwind CSS classes to style the search bar and links. The search bar has a dark background and white text. The links have a dark background and light text. The shopping cart link has an image of a shopping cart and the number of items in the cart next to it.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project as a reusable component that can be included in multiple pages of the online store. It provides a consistent user interface for searching for products and accessing the shopping cart and checkout pages. Developers can customize the component's appearance and behavior by modifying the Tailwind CSS classes and the links' URLs. For example, they can change the color scheme, add or remove links, or change the text displayed on the links. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport HeroSection from \"zoo/components/HeroSection\";\n\nconst HomePage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <HeroSection />\n      {/* other content */}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default HomePage;\n```",
