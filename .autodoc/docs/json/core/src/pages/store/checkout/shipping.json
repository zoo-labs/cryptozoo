  "summary": "The `Info` component is responsible for rendering the shipping information form and the payment information for the checkout process of the online store. It imports several dependencies such as `Link` from Next.js, `useEffect` and `useState` from React, and `useAppSelector` from the store's hooks. It also imports the `CartItem` type from the `cart` file and the `countries` array from the `data` folder.\n\nThe component initializes several state variables using the `useState` hook. The `shippingDetails` state variable is an object that contains the user's email, first name, and last name. The `shippingPrice` state variable is a number that represents the shipping cost. The `subTotal` state variable is a number that represents the total cost of the items in the cart. The `country` state variable is a string that represents the user's country.\n\nThe component also initializes a `settings` object that is used to configure the `Slider` component from the `react-slick` library. The `handleChange` function is used to update the `shippingDetails` state variable when the user inputs their information into the form.\n\nThe `useAppSelector` hook is used to retrieve the `CartItems` array from the store. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `subTotal` state variable whenever the `CartItems` array changes.\n\nThe `Info` component renders a form that allows the user to input their shipping information. The form includes fields for the user's email, first name, last name, address, city, state, postal code, and phone number. The form also includes a checkbox that allows the user to opt-in to receive news and offers via email.\n\nThe component also renders a section that displays the user's cart items. The `Slider` component is used to display each item in a carousel. The component also displays the subtotal, shipping cost, and total cost of the items in the cart.\n\nThe component includes buttons that allow the user to continue to the payment information section or return to the cart. The `Link` component from Next.js is used to create these buttons.\n\nOverall, the `Info` component is an important part of the checkout process for the online store. It allows the user to input their shipping information and displays the cost of their items and shipping. The component is reusable and can be used in other parts of the project that require shipping information input.",
