  "summary": "The `Shipping` component is responsible for rendering the shipping and payment information for the zoo project. It is a functional component that returns a JSX element. \n\nThe component is divided into two sections: the shipping section and the payment section. The shipping section displays the contact information, shipping address, and shipping method. Each section has a \"Change\" button that allows the user to modify the information. \n\nThe payment section displays a list of payment options. Each payment option is represented by an image and a radio button. The user can select one of the payment options to proceed with the payment. \n\nAt the bottom of the payment section, there is a \"Pay Now\" button that the user can click to complete the payment process. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project by importing it and rendering it in a parent component that handles the overall checkout process. For example, the `Shipping` component can be rendered in a `Checkout` component that also handles the cart items and the total amount. \n\nHere is an example of how the `Shipping` component can be used in a `Checkout` component:\n\n```\nimport Shipping from './Shipping';\n\nconst Checkout = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* Render cart items and total amount */}\n      <Shipping />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Checkout;\n```\n\nOverall, the `Shipping` component provides a user-friendly interface for the shipping and payment information in the zoo project.",
