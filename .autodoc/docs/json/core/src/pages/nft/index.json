  "summary": "The `Nft` component is a React component that renders a page for displaying information about a specific NFT (non-fungible token). The page is divided into two main sections: an image of the NFT and a section with details about the NFT.\n\nThe image section displays an animated GIF of an egg and a button to place a bid. The egg image is wrapped in a div that has a reference set to `nftImageRef`. This reference is used in the `useEffect` hook to apply an animation to the image when the component mounts. The animation is defined in the `fadeInFromLeft` function, which is imported from the `animation` module. The button to place a bid is styled with a gradient background and a rounded shape.\n\nThe details section displays information about the NFT, including its name, description, and various metadata. The section is divided into two parts: a box with general details and a box with proof of authenticity. The general details box is wrapped in a div that has a reference set to `nftContentRef`. This reference is used in the `useEffect` hook to apply an animation to the box when the component mounts. The animation is defined in the `fadeInFromRight` function, which is also imported from the `animation` module.\n\nThe proof of authenticity box displays a price in $ZOO and a link to view the NFT on IPS (InterPlanetary File System). The link is styled with an arrow icon and is clickable.\n\nAt the bottom of the page, there is a section that displays popular NFTs and a link to view all NFTs.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project as a template for displaying information about individual NFTs. It can be customized with different images, descriptions, and metadata to display information about different NFTs. The animation functions can also be reused in other parts of the project to apply consistent animations.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?\n- The `useEffect` hook is used to trigger the `fadeInFromLeft` and `fadeInFromRight` animations on the `nftImageRef` and `nftContentRef` elements respectively, when the component mounts.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `Image` component imported from \"next/image\"?\n- The `Image` component is used to display an image with optimized performance and user experience, by automatically optimizing images based on the device and network conditions.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `PopularNftsSection` component imported from \"pages/home/PopularNftsSection\"?\n- The `PopularNftsSection` component is used to display a section of popular NFTs on the home page of the application.",
