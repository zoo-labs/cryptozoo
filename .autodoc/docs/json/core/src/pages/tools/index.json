  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `Tools` that renders a page displaying a list of tools available on the SushiSwap platform. The component imports various modules including `ArrowRightIcon` from `@heroicons/react/outline`, `Container` from `../../components/Container`, `Head` from `next/head`, `I18n` from `@lingui/core`, `Link` from `next/link`, `Typography` from `../../components/Typography`, `t` from `@lingui/macro`, and `useLingui` from `@lingui/react`. \n\nThe `TOOLS` constant is an array of objects that represent the tools available on the platform. Each object has an `id`, `name`, `description`, and `href` property. The `name` property represents the name of the tool, the `description` property provides a brief description of the tool, and the `href` property is the URL to the tool's page. The `description` property is localized using the `i18n` object passed as an argument to the `TOOLS` function.\n\nThe `Tools` component uses the `useLingui` hook to get the current language and the `TOOL` constant to generate a list of tools. The list is rendered using the `map` function to iterate over each tool object and generate a list item for each tool. Each list item contains a link to the tool's page, the tool's name, and a brief description of the tool. The `ArrowRightIcon` is used to indicate that the link leads to the tool's page.\n\nThe `Typography` component is used to render the page title \"Tools\". The `Head` component is used to set the page title and description in the HTML head element.\n\nThis component can be used as a template for displaying a list of tools on any page of the SushiSwap platform. The `TOOLS` constant can be modified to add or remove tools from the list, and the `Link` component can be used to link to the tool's page. The `Typography` component can be used to set the page title, and the `Head` component can be used to set the page title and description in the HTML head element.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TOOLS` constant?\n- The `TOOLS` constant is an array of objects that contains information about different tools available on the SushiSwap platform, including their names, descriptions, and links.\n\n2. What is the role of the `useMemo` hook in this code?\n- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the `TOOLS` array based on the current `i18n` object from the Lingui library. This helps to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders when the `i18n` object changes.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ArrowRightIcon` component?\n- The `ArrowRightIcon` component is an icon from the Heroicons library that is used to display a right arrow next to each tool on the page, indicating that clicking on the tool will take the user to a new page.",
