  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `NotFound` that renders a custom 404 error page. The purpose of this component is to provide a user-friendly message to the user when they try to access a page that does not exist. \n\nThe component uses the `Link` component from the `next/link` library to create a link to the homepage of the website. The `Link` component is used to create client-side navigation between pages, which is faster than traditional server-side navigation. \n\nThe `NotFound` component is designed to be used in a larger project, such as a website or web application, where it can be imported and used whenever a user tries to access a page that does not exist. By using this component, developers can provide a consistent and user-friendly experience to their users when they encounter a 404 error. \n\nHere is an example of how the `NotFound` component can be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport NotFound from './components/NotFound';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Router>\n        <Switch>\n          <Route exact path=\"/\" component={HomePage} />\n          <Route path=\"/about\" component={AboutPage} />\n          <Route path=\"/contact\" component={ContactPage} />\n          <Route component={NotFound} />\n        </Switch>\n      </Router>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `NotFound` component is used as the fallback route in a `Switch` component that defines the routes for the website. If the user tries to access a page that does not exist, the `NotFound` component will be rendered instead. \n\nOverall, the `NotFound` component is a useful tool for providing a better user experience in a larger project by handling 404 errors in a consistent and user-friendly way.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Link` import from \"next/link\"?\n   \n   The `Link` import is used to create a hyperlink to the homepage in the `NotFound` component.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `flex` and `items-center` classes in the `div` element?\n   \n   The `flex` class is used to create a flexible container for the child elements, while the `items-center` class is used to center the child elements horizontally and vertically within the container.\n\n3. Why is the `NotFound` component exported as the default export?\n   \n   The `NotFound` component is exported as the default export so that it can be imported and used in other parts of the `zoo` project without needing to specify a specific name for the import.",
