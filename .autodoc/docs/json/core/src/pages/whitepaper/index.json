  "summary": "The code above is a React component called `WhitePaper`. It imports a component called `ComingSoon` from a file located at \"components/ComingSoon\". The purpose of this component is to display a message indicating that the white paper for the project is coming soon. \n\nThe `WhitePaper` component returns a div element with a class name of \"mt-16\" and renders the `ComingSoon` component inside it. The `ComingSoon` component likely contains a message or graphic indicating that the white paper is not yet available but will be released in the future. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to inform users that the white paper is not yet available but is coming soon. It can be placed on a landing page or other relevant section of the website to keep users informed about the project's progress. \n\nHere is an example of how the `WhitePaper` component can be used in a larger React application:\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport WhitePaper from \"./components/WhitePaper\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo Project</h1>\n      <p>Learn more about our project by reading our white paper.</p>\n      <WhitePaper />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `WhitePaper` component is imported and rendered inside the `App` component. The `App` component displays a welcome message and encourages users to read the white paper. The `WhitePaper` component is then rendered below the message to inform users that the white paper is coming soon.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ComingSoon` component?\n   - The `ComingSoon` component is likely a placeholder for a feature or content that is not yet available in the current version of the project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `mt-16` class name in the `div` element?\n   - The `mt-16` class name likely adds a margin-top of 16 pixels to the `div` element, which could affect the layout of the surrounding elements.\n\n3. What is the `WhitePaper` component used for in the `zoo` project?\n   - The `WhitePaper` component is likely a page or section of the project that displays information about a white paper, but without any content yet since it only renders the `ComingSoon` component.",
