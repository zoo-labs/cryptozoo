  "summary": "The `RewardCalculator` component is a React component that calculates the potential rewards for a user based on the collateral amount, term, and animal selected. The component imports several components from external libraries such as `recharts` and `components/Slider`. It also imports a custom hook `useGetAvailableEggs` from the `zoo` slice of the Redux store.\n\nThe component renders a form with three input fields: Collateral Amount, Term, and Animal. The Collateral Amount field is disabled, while the Term and Animal fields are dropdown menus. The Term dropdown menu has three options: 6 months, 12 months, and 18 months. The Animal dropdown menu is populated with options based on the available eggs in the Redux store. The options are dynamically generated based on the `availableEggs` state variable.\n\nWhen the user selects a Term and an Animal, the component calculates the potential rewards based on the yield of the selected animal and the selected term. The calculation is done in the `handleChange` function, which generates an array of objects representing the monthly rewards for the selected term. The array is then passed to a `LineChart` component from the `recharts` library, which displays the data in a line chart.\n\nThe component also includes a `MarketTypeSlider` component from the `components/Slider` library, which allows the user to adjust the potential rewards based on the market type. The slider has seven positions, ranging from \"Super Bearish\" to \"Moon\". The selected position is used to calculate the potential rewards, which are displayed in the `LineChart`.\n\nOverall, the `RewardCalculator` component is a useful tool for users to calculate their potential rewards based on their collateral amount, term, animal, and market type. It provides a visual representation of the potential rewards in a line chart, which can help users make informed decisions about their investments.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useGetAvailableEggs` hook and how is it used in this code?\n   \n   The `useGetAvailableEggs` hook is used to fetch a list of available eggs from the zoo state. It is called in the `useEffect` hook to fetch the eggs when the component mounts.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `handleChange` function and how is it used in this code?\n   \n   The `handleChange` function is used to generate data for the line chart based on the selected time frame and animal yield. It returns an array of objects with the name of the month and the corresponding amount of yield. It is called in the `useMemo` hook to memoize the data and avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `MarketTypeSlider` component and how is it used in this code?\n   \n   The `MarketTypeSlider` component is used to display a slider that allows the user to select a market type and see the corresponding earning potential. It is used in the second column of the grid to display the slider and the earning potential values. The `onChange` prop is used to update the `earning` state when the slider value changes.",
