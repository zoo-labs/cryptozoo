  "summary": "The `CreateAuctionPage` component is a React component that renders a form for creating an auction. It imports several hooks from different modules to manage state and dispatch actions. \n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of four input fields: `tokenId`, `duration`, `reservedPrice`, and `curatorFeePercentage`. It also uses the `useCreateAuction` hook to create an auction, the `useDispatch` hook to dispatch the created auction, and the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the current user's account. \n\nWhen the user submits the form, the `onSubmit` function is called. This function prevents the default form submission behavior and converts the input values to numbers. It then dispatches the `createAuction` action with the converted values. \n\nThe component renders a form with four input fields and a submit button. The input fields are controlled components that update the state when the user types in them. The submit button triggers the `onSubmit` function when clicked. \n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that involves creating and managing auctions. It provides a simple and reusable form for creating auctions. Developers can customize the form by adding or removing input fields or modifying the `onSubmit` function to perform additional actions. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport CreateAuctionPage from 'zoo/CreateAuctionPage';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CreateAuctionPage />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useCreateAuction` hook and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `useCreateAuction` hook is likely a custom hook that provides functionality for creating an auction. It is used in the `onSubmit` function to dispatch an action that creates an auction with the inputted values.\n2. What is the purpose of the `useActiveWeb3React` hook and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is likely a custom hook that provides access to the active Web3 React context. It is used to retrieve the current account, which is logged to the console for debugging purposes.\n3. What is the purpose of the `parseInt` function call in the `onChange` function for the `curatorFeePercentage` input?\n   - The `parseInt` function call is used to convert the input value to an integer before setting the state with `setCuratorFeePercentage`. This is likely done to ensure that the value is a valid number and can be used in calculations later on.",
