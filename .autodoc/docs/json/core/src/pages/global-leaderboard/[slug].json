  "summary": "The `Slug` component is a React functional component that renders a page for displaying information about a specific item in the zoo project. The component imports the `useState` and `useRouter` hooks from the `react` and `next/router` packages respectively, and the `Image` component from the `next/image` package. \n\nThe component defines a `Props` type that is an empty object and a `Slug` type that is a React functional component that takes in the `Props` type as a parameter. The component then destructures the `router.query` object to get the `slug` value and initializes a `category` state variable to 0 using the `useState` hook.\n\nThe component defines an array of `items` that contains objects representing different items in the zoo project. Each object has an `id`, `nftId`, `nftName`, `nftImg`, and `price` property. \n\nThe component then returns a JSX element that contains several nested elements. The first element is a div that contains a gradient background and three clickable links that represent different categories of items. The `category` state variable is used to determine which link is currently active. When a link is clicked, the `setCategory` function is called to update the `category` state variable.\n\nThe second element is a div that contains information about the specific item being displayed. It has a gradient background and displays the `slug` value along with other information such as the user and address associated with the item.\n\nThe third element is a div that contains information about the item's details. It has a black background and displays information such as the transaction, token ID, and token standard associated with the item.\n\nThe fourth element is a div that contains information about the item's authenticity. It has a black background and displays the price of the item in $ZOO, a link to an Etherscan transaction, and a link to view the item on IPS.\n\nThe fifth element is a div that maps over the `items` array and renders information about each item. It displays the item's image, name, description, and details. It also has a button that allows users to make an offer on the item.\n\nOverall, the `Slug` component is a reusable component that can be used to display information about any item in the zoo project. It uses state variables and hooks to allow users to navigate between different categories of items and make offers on specific items.",
