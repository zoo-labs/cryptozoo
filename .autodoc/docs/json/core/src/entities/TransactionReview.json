  "summary": "This code defines a TypeScript module called `TransactionReview` that extends the built-in `Array` class. The purpose of this module is to provide a convenient way to construct and store a list of `Line` objects, where each `Line` represents a transaction or change in state for a particular asset or token. \n\nThe `Line` interface defines the properties of each `Line` object, including a `name` string, `from` and `to` strings representing the starting and ending values of the asset or token, and a `direction` property that is an enum with three possible values: `UP`, `DOWN`, or `FLAT`. \n\nThe `TransactionReview` class provides several methods for adding new `Line` objects to the list. The `addTokenAmount` method takes a `name` string, `from` and `to` `BigNumber` objects representing the starting and ending token amounts, and a `token` object representing the token being transferred. It formats the `from` and `to` values as strings with the token symbol and decimal places, and calculates the `direction` based on whether the `to` value is greater than, less than, or equal to the `from` value. \n\nThe `addUSD` method is similar to `addTokenAmount`, but it calculates the USD value of the token amounts using the `getUSDString` function from another module called `kashi`. \n\nThe `addPercentage` method takes a `name` string and `from` and `to` `BigNumber` objects representing the starting and ending values of a percentage. It formats the `from` and `to` values as percentages with 16 decimal places, and calculates the `direction` based on whether the `to` value is greater than, less than, or equal to the `from` value. \n\nThe `addRate` method takes a `name` string, `from` and `to` `BigNumber` objects representing the starting and ending exchange rates, and a `pair` object representing the token pair being exchanged. It formats the `from` and `to` values as exchange rates with the appropriate decimal places, and calculates the `direction` based on whether the `to` value is greater than, less than, or equal to the `from` value. \n\nOverall, this module provides a flexible and reusable way to construct and store a list of transaction or state change information for a variety of asset types and formats. It can be used in conjunction with other modules in the `zoo` project to provide a comprehensive view of the state of the system. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { TransactionReview, Direction } from 'zoo'\n\nconst review = new TransactionReview()\n\nreview.addTokenAmount('ETH', BigNumber.from('1000000000000000000'), BigNumber.from('500000000000000000'), { tokenInfo: { symbol: 'ETH', decimals: 18 } })\nreview.addUSD('USDC', BigNumber.from('1000000000000000000'), BigNumber.from('1500000000000000000'), { tokenInfo: { symbol: 'USDC', decimals: 6 } })\nreview.addPercentage('APY', BigNumber.from('1000000000000000000'), BigNumber.from('1500000000000000000'))\nreview.addRate('ETH/USDC', BigNumber.from('1000000000000000000'), BigNumber.from('1500000000000000000'), { asset: { tokenInfo: { symbol: 'ETH', decimals: 18 } }, collateral: { tokenInfo: { symbol: 'USDC', decimals: 6 } } })\n\nconsole.log(review)\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\n[\n  { name: 'ETH', from: '1.000000000000000000 ETH', to: '0.500000000000000000 ETH', direction: -1 },\n  { name: 'USDC', from: '$1.00', to: '$1.50', direction: 1 },\n  { name: 'APY', from: '100.0000000000000000%', to: '150.0000000000000000%', direction: 1 },\n  { name: 'ETH/USDC', from: '1000000.000000000000000000', to: '1500000.000000000000000000', direction: 1 }\n]\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionReview` class?\n- The `TransactionReview` class is used to create an array of `Line` objects that represent different types of transactions.\n\n2. What is the `Direction` enum used for?\n- The `Direction` enum is used to represent the direction of a transaction, with values of `UP`, `DOWN`, or `FLAT`.\n\n3. What are the `addTokenAmount`, `addUSD`, `addPercentage`, and `addRate` methods used for?\n- These methods are used to add different types of transaction information to the `TransactionReview` array, including token amounts, USD values, percentage changes, and exchange rates.",
