  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `TokenWarningModal` that renders a modal window with a list of tokens and a confirmation button. The purpose of this component is to display a warning message to the user when they attempt to import a token that already exists in their wallet. The component takes three props: `isOpen`, `tokens`, and `onConfirm`. \n\nThe `isOpen` prop is a boolean that determines whether the modal is visible or not. The `tokens` prop is an array of `Token` objects that represent the tokens that are already in the user's wallet. The `onConfirm` prop is a callback function that is called when the user clicks the confirmation button.\n\nThe component renders a `Modal` component from the `../../components/Modal` module. The `Modal` component is a reusable component that provides a basic modal window with a header, body, and footer. The `isOpen` prop is passed to the `Modal` component to control its visibility. The `handleDismiss` function is defined using the `useCallback` hook, but it does not do anything.\n\nInside the `Modal` component, the `ImportToken` component from the `../SearchModal/ImportToken` module is rendered. The `ImportToken` component is a custom component that displays a list of tokens and allows the user to select one. The `tokens` prop is passed to the `ImportToken` component to populate the list. The `handleCurrencySelect` prop is passed to the `ImportToken` component as a callback function that is called when the user selects a token. This function is actually the `onConfirm` prop that was passed to the `TokenWarningModal` component.\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple way to display a warning message to the user when they attempt to import a token that already exists in their wallet. The `TokenWarningModal` component can be used in conjunction with other components in the `zoo` project to provide a more complete user interface for managing tokens. For example, it could be used in a settings page where the user can manage their wallet and import new tokens.",

What dependencies does this code have?\n   This code imports `React`, `useCallback`, `ImportToken`, `Modal`, and `Token` from various modules.\n\n3. What props does the `TokenWarningModal` component expect?\n   The `TokenWarningModal` component expects an `isOpen` boolean, an array of `tokens`, and an `onConfirm` function as props.",
