  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `TransactionFailedModal` that displays a modal dialog box with a message indicating that a transaction has been rejected. The component takes two props: `isOpen`, a boolean that determines whether the modal is visible, and `onDismiss`, a function that is called when the modal is dismissed.\n\nThe modal contains an image of a red X, a heading that says \"Uh Oh! Transaction rejected.\", and a button labeled \"Dismiss\". The text of the button is localized using the `@lingui/macro` and `@lingui/react` packages.\n\nThe component uses several other components and libraries to implement the modal. The `CloseIcon` component is imported from a file located in the `components` directory, and is used to display a clickable X icon in the upper-right corner of the modal. The `Image` component is imported from the `next/image` package, and is used to display the transaction-rejected.png image. The `Modal` component is imported from a file located in the `components` directory, and is used to display the modal dialog box.\n\nThe component is intended to be used in a larger project that involves transactions, such as a cryptocurrency exchange or a payment processing system. When a transaction is rejected, this component can be used to display a user-friendly error message to the user, indicating that the transaction was not successful and providing a way to dismiss the message. The component can be customized by changing the image, the heading, and the button text to fit the specific needs of the project. For example, the image could be replaced with a different icon or logo, and the heading could be changed to provide more specific information about the reason for the transaction rejection.",
