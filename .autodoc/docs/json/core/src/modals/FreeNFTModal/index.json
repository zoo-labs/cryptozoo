  "summary": "The `FreeNFTModal` component is a React component that renders a modal for freeing an NFT. It is part of the larger `zoo` project and is imported from various other files within the project. \n\nThe component imports several hooks from the `application` and `zoo` state slices, including `useModalOpen`, `useFreeNftModal`, and `useFreeNFT`. It also imports several components from the `components` folder, including `Modal`, `ModalHeader`, and `ModelViewer`. \n\nThe component takes an `nft` prop, which is an object representing the NFT to be freed. The modal displays a preview of the NFT, along with a message asking the user if they are sure they want to free the animal. If the user confirms, the NFT is freed and the collateral is returned, but the NFT is lost forever. \n\nThe `FreeNFTModal` component uses several hooks to manage state and handle user interactions. For example, it uses the `useModalOpen` hook to determine whether the modal is open, and the `useFreeNftModal` hook to toggle the modal. It also uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the user's account information, and the `useRouter` hook to navigate to a different page after the NFT is freed. \n\nThe component also defines several callback functions, including `successCallback`, which is called after the NFT is freed and navigates the user to the wallet page, and `freeNft`, which frees the NFT if the user is logged in and shows a wallet modal if they are not. \n\nThe `FreeNFTModal` component renders a `Modal` component that wraps the modal content. The modal content is defined in the `getModalContent` function, which returns a JSX element that displays the NFT preview, confirmation message, and \"Set Free\" button. The \"Set Free\" button is disabled if the NFT is currently being freed. \n\nOverall, the `FreeNFTModal` component provides a way for users to free their NFTs and get their collateral back, but at the cost of losing the NFT forever. It is a small but important part of the larger `zoo` project, which is likely a platform for buying, selling, and trading NFTs related to animals.",
