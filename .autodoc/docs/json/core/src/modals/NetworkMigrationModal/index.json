  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a modal for network migration in the zoo project. The modal is triggered by a button click and displays a countdown timer, a button to burn tokens, and a link to copy the burn address. The countdown timer is calculated based on the difference between the current date and a hardcoded end date. The timer is updated every minute using a setInterval function. The burn button calls a function that transfers the user's zoo tokens to a hardcoded burn address. The amount of tokens transferred is calculated based on the user's zoo balance. The burn address is copied to the clipboard when the user clicks the copy link. The component uses several hooks from the zoo project, including useModalOpen, useNetworkMigrationModalToggle, useTransferZoo, and useSelector. It also imports several components and libraries, including Modal, ModalHeader, Web3, and dynamic. The ModelViewer component is loaded dynamically using the dynamic function from Next.js. The component is exported as the default export of the file and can be used in other parts of the zoo project by importing it and rendering it as a React component. For example:\n\n```\nimport NetworkMigrationModal from 'zoo/components/NetworkMigrationModal';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my component</h1>\n      <NetworkMigrationModal />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code is a React component that renders a modal for network migration. It includes a countdown timer, a button to burn tokens, and a link to copy a burn address.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries and dependencies, including React, Redux, MUI, Web3, and Next.js.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `ssr: false` option in the `dynamic` import statement?\n- The `ssr: false` option in the `dynamic` import statement ensures that the `ModelViewer` component is not rendered on the server side, but only on the client side. This is important for performance reasons and to avoid issues with server-side rendering.",
