  "summary": "The `CastVoteModal` component is a React component that renders a modal for confirming a vote on a proposal. It imports various hooks and components from the project's codebase and uses them to display information about the vote and allow the user to confirm or cancel their vote.\n\nThe component takes in several props, including the type of vote (approve or disapprove), a function to vote on the proposal, the user's voting power, and the number of approvals and disapprovals for the proposal. It also uses the `useSelector` hook to access the user's Zoo balance and the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the user's account.\n\nThe component renders a modal with information about the vote, including the user's voting power, the number of approvals and disapprovals, and the amount of Zoo required to vote. If the user has enough voting power, they can confirm their vote by clicking a button. If they do not have enough voting power, they must first approve the contract to spend their Zoo tokens on their behalf. The component uses the `useVotingApproveCallback` hook to handle this approval process.\n\nThe `CastVoteModal` component is used in the larger project to allow users to vote on proposals in the Zoo ecosystem. It provides a user-friendly interface for confirming votes and handles the approval process for spending Zoo tokens. The component can be easily customized to fit the project's design and functionality needs. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\n<CastVoteModal\n  vote=\"approve\"\n  voteProposal={handleVoteProposal}\n  votingPower={100}\n  approvedCount={10}\n  disapprovedCount={5}\n/>\n```",
