  "summary": "The `NetworkModal` component is responsible for rendering a modal that allows users to switch between different Ethereum networks. The component imports various constants and hooks from other files in the project, including the `networks` configuration file and several custom hooks defined in the `application` and `hooks` directories.\n\nThe component first retrieves the current chain ID, library, and account using the `useActiveWeb3React` hook. It then checks if the chain ID is defined, and if not, returns `null` to prevent the modal from rendering.\n\nAssuming the chain ID is defined, the component renders a `Modal` component from the `components` directory, which displays a header with a \"Select a Network\" title and a message indicating the current network being used by the user. The available networks are then displayed in a grid, with each network represented by a button that includes an icon, label, and background color gradient. If the user is currently on a particular network, the corresponding button is highlighted with a different background color gradient.\n\nWhen a user clicks on a network button, the `toggleNetworkModal` function is called to close the modal, and a cookie is set to store the selected chain ID. Depending on whether the selected network is supported by MetaMask, the `library` object is used to call either the `wallet_switchEthereumChain` or `wallet_addEthereumChain` method to switch to the new network.\n\nOverall, the `NetworkModal` component provides a user-friendly way for users to switch between different Ethereum networks, which is an important feature for decentralized applications that may be deployed on multiple networks. The component can be used in conjunction with other components and hooks in the `application` and `hooks` directories to provide a seamless user experience for interacting with the Zoo project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is responsible for rendering a modal that allows the user to select a network to connect to.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `next/image`, `react`, and `cookie-cutter`.\n\n3. What happens if the `chainId` is not defined?\n- If the `chainId` is not defined, the function returns `null` and the modal is not rendered.",
