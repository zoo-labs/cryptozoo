  "summary": "The `CurrencySearchModal` component is a React component that provides a modal view for searching and selecting currencies. It is part of the larger `zoo` project and uses several other components and hooks from the project.\n\nThe component takes several props, including `isOpen`, `onDismiss`, `selectedCurrency`, and `onCurrencySelect`. When the modal is open, the user can search for currencies using the `CurrencySearch` component, which is displayed when `modalView` is set to `CurrencyModalView.search`. The user can select a currency, which triggers the `handleCurrencySelect` callback and closes the modal.\n\nThe `CurrencySearch` component provides a search bar and a list of currencies that match the search query. It also allows the user to import a token or manage the token list. When the user clicks the \"Import\" button, the `modalView` is set to `CurrencyModalView.importToken`, which displays the `ImportToken` component. This component allows the user to import a token by entering its address or scanning a QR code. When the user selects a token, the `handleCurrencySelect` callback is triggered and the modal is closed.\n\nThe `ImportToken` component also allows the user to go back to the previous view by clicking the \"Back\" button. If the previous view was not the import token view, the `modalView` is set to the previous view. If the previous view was the import token view, the `modalView` is set to the search view.\n\nThe `CurrencySearchModal` component also provides a `Manage` view, which allows the user to manage the token list. When the user clicks the \"Manage\" button, the `modalView` is set to `CurrencyModalView.manage`, which displays the `Manage` component. This component allows the user to add or remove tokens from the token list, as well as import a token list from a URL.\n\nThe `CurrencySearchModal` component uses several hooks, including `useState`, `useEffect`, `useCallback`, `useLast`, and `usePrevious`. These hooks allow the component to manage its state and respond to changes in props and state.\n\nOverall, the `CurrencySearchModal` component provides a flexible and extensible modal view for searching and selecting currencies in the `zoo` project. It can be used in various parts of the project where currency selection is required, such as in trading or portfolio management.",
