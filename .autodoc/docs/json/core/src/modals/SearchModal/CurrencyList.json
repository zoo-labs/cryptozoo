  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a list of currencies. It imports various components and hooks from the project's codebase and external libraries. The component takes in several props, including an array of currencies to display, a selected currency, and a callback function to handle currency selection. \n\nThe component renders a list of currencies using the `FixedSizeList` component from the `react-window` library. Each currency is rendered as a `CurrencyRow` component, which displays the currency's logo, symbol, name, and balance. The `CurrencyRow` component also displays tags associated with the currency, such as whether it was added by the user or is part of an inactive token list. \n\nThe component also includes a `BreakLineComponent` that is rendered between the list of currencies and any inactive token lists. The `BreakLineComponent` displays a message indicating that the following tokens are from inactive lists and provides a tooltip with more information. \n\nThe `CurrencyList` component is used in other parts of the project to display a list of currencies, such as in a dropdown menu for selecting a currency to trade. The component can be customized with various props to control its behavior and appearance. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { CurrencyList } from \"@zoolabs/zdk\";\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const currencies = [/* array of Currency objects */];\n  const [selectedCurrency, setSelectedCurrency] = useState(null);\n\n  function handleCurrencySelect(currency) {\n    setSelectedCurrency(currency);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <CurrencyList\n      height={400}\n      currencies={currencies}\n      selectedCurrency={selectedCurrency}\n      onCurrencySelect={handleCurrencySelect}\n    />\n  );\n}\n```",
