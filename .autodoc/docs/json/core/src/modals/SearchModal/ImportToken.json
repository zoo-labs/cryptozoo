  "summary": "The `ImportToken` function in this file is a React component that renders a modal for importing tokens. It takes in an array of `Token` objects, a `TokenList` object, and several optional callback functions as props. \n\nThe component first imports several components from other files, including `AutoRow`, `RowFixed`, `Currency`, `Token`, `AlertTriangle`, `AutoColumn`, `Button`, `Card`, `CurrencyLogo`, `ExternalLink`, `ListLogo`, `ModalHeader`, `Typography`, and several functions from other files. \n\nThe component then defines a `useActiveWeb3React` hook and a `useLingui` hook to access the active Web3 context and the Lingui internationalization library, respectively. It also defines an `addToken` function using the `useAddUserToken` hook from the `user` state slice. \n\nThe component then renders a modal with a header that displays the number of tokens being imported. It also displays a warning message and a list of the tokens being imported, along with their logos, symbols, names, and addresses. If a `TokenList` object is provided, it also displays the list's logo and name. If not, it displays an \"Unknown Source\" warning. \n\nFinally, the component renders an \"Import\" button that, when clicked, calls the `addToken` function for each token being imported and calls the `handleCurrencySelect` callback function with the first token in the array. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to allow users to import tokens that are not on the active token list(s) for trading. It provides a user-friendly interface for displaying information about the tokens being imported and allows users to add them to their personal token lists.",
