  "summary": "The `Option` component is a reusable React component that renders an option item with an icon, header, and subheader. It can be used in various parts of the larger project, such as a navigation menu or a settings page. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `link`, `clickable`, `size`, `onClick`, `color`, `header`, `subheader`, `icon`, `active`, and `id`. \n\nThe `link` prop is an optional string that specifies the URL to link to when the option is clicked. If `link` is provided, the component returns an anchor tag with the `content` as its child. If `link` is not provided, the component returns the `content` div.\n\nThe `clickable` prop is a boolean that determines whether the option is clickable or not. If `clickable` is `false`, the cursor is set to `not-allowed`.\n\nThe `size` prop is an optional number that specifies the size of the option. If `size` is not provided, the default size is used.\n\nThe `onClick` prop is an optional function that is called when the option is clicked.\n\nThe `color` prop is a required string that specifies the background color of the option.\n\nThe `header` prop is a required React node that specifies the main text of the option.\n\nThe `subheader` prop is an optional React node that specifies the subtext of the option.\n\nThe `icon` prop is a required string that specifies the URL of the icon to display.\n\nThe `active` prop is a boolean that determines whether the option is active or not. If `active` is `true`, the option is highlighted with a gradient background.\n\nThe `id` prop is a required string that specifies the ID of the option.\n\nThe `content` variable is a div that contains the header, subheader, and icon. The header and subheader are wrapped in divs with appropriate styles. The icon is an `Image` component from the `next/image` library.\n\nIf `link` is provided, the `content` div is returned as a child of an anchor tag. If `link` is not provided and `active` is `false`, the `content` div is returned. If `link` is not provided and `active` is `true`, the `content` div is returned as a child of a div with a gradient background.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<Option\n  link=\"/home\"\n  clickable={true}\n  size={24}\n  onClick={() => console.log(\"Option clicked\")}\n  color=\"#FF0000\"\n  header=\"Home\"\n  subheader=\"Go to the homepage\"\n  icon=\"/icons/home.svg\"\n  active={false}\n  id=\"home-option\"\n/>\n```",
