  "summary": "The `WalletModal` component is responsible for rendering a modal that allows users to connect their wallets to the application. It imports various dependencies such as React, `useEffect`, `useState`, and several other components and hooks from the application.\n\nThe component defines a constant object `WALLET_VIEWS` that contains different views of the wallet modal, such as `OPTIONS`, `ACCOUNT`, and `PENDING`. It then defines the `WalletModal` function that takes in an object with three properties: `pendingTransactions`, `confirmedTransactions`, and `ENSName`. These properties are used to display the user's account details and pending transactions.\n\nThe function then uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the current account, chain ID, and connector. It also uses the `useLingui` hook to get the current language and the `useModalOpen` and `useWalletModalToggle` hooks to open and close the wallet modal.\n\nThe `WalletModal` function defines several `useEffect` hooks that handle the opening and closing of the modal, resetting the wallet view, and closing the modal on successful connection. It also defines a `getOptions` function that returns a list of wallet options that the user can connect to, depending on the device and browser.\n\nFinally, the `WalletModal` function returns a `Modal` component that displays the modal content. The content is determined by the current wallet view and whether there is an error connecting to the wallet. If there is an error, the modal displays an error message and a button to disconnect. If the user is connected and the wallet view is `ACCOUNT`, the modal displays the user's account details and pending transactions. Otherwise, the modal displays a list of wallet options and a link to learn more about wallets.\n\nOverall, the `WalletModal` component is an important part of the application's user interface, allowing users to connect their wallets and interact with the application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code is a React component that renders a modal for selecting and connecting to different wallets. It uses various connectors from the `@web3-react` library and supports multiple wallets including MetaMask, WalletConnect, and Fortmatic.\n\n2. How does the code handle errors and what types of errors can occur?\n- The code handles errors by displaying an error message in the modal if there is an issue connecting to a wallet. Errors can include unsupported chain IDs, connection errors, and activation errors. The user can disconnect and try again or refresh the page.\n\n3. What is the role of the `useEffect` hooks in this code?\n- The `useEffect` hooks are used to handle various side effects such as closing the modal when a connection is successful, resetting the wallet view when the modal is opened, and detecting changes in the active connector or account. They also handle the case where the user is logged out and closes the modal.",
