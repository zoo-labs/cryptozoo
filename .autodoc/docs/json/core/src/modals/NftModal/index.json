  "summary": "The `NftModal` component is a React functional component that renders a modal window containing information about a specific NFT (non-fungible token) item. The component receives several props, including the `nftItem` object, which contains information about the NFT, such as its name, attributes, and kind. The component also receives several callback functions, including `hatchEgg`, `feed`, `breed`, and `auction`, which are used to perform various actions related to the NFT.\n\nThe modal window is composed of two main sections: the left section displays a video or 3D model of the NFT, depending on its kind, while the right section displays various information about the NFT, such as its name, attributes, age, and description. The right section also contains several buttons that allow the user to perform various actions related to the NFT, such as hatching an egg, feeding the NFT, breeding it, or putting it up for auction.\n\nThe component uses several other components and libraries, such as `Modal` from the `components` directory, `BidModalHeader` from the `components/ModalHeader` directory, `Image` from the `next/image` library, `AccessAlarmRoundedIcon` from the `@mui/icons-material` library, and `ModelViewer` from the `components` directory. The component also uses several custom hooks from the `state/application/hooks` directory, such as `useMyNftModalToggle` and `useModalOpen`.\n\nOverall, the `NftModal` component provides a convenient way to display and interact with NFT items in the larger project. It allows users to view detailed information about their NFTs, as well as perform various actions related to them, such as hatching eggs, feeding, breeding, or auctioning them.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code defines a React functional component called `NftModal` that renders a modal window displaying information about a specific NFT item, as well as buttons to perform actions such as hatching, feeding, breeding, and auctioning the NFT.\n\n2. What external libraries or components does this code use?\n- This code imports several external libraries and components, including `React`, `next/image`, `@mui/icons-material`, `moment`, and a custom `Modal` component. It also uses a dynamic import to load a `ModelViewer` component from a separate file.\n\n3. What are the props passed to the `NftModal` component and how are they used?\n- The `NftModal` component receives four props: `nftItem`, `hatchEgg`, `feed`, `breed`, and `auction`. These props are used to display information about the NFT item and to define the behavior of the action buttons in the modal window. For example, clicking the \"HATCH\" button calls the `hatchEgg` function passed as a prop.",
