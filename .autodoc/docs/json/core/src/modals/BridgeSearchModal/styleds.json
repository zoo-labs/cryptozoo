  "summary": "This file contains a set of styled components that can be used to create various UI elements in the larger project. The purpose of this code is to provide a consistent and reusable set of styles for different components across the project. \n\nThe `ModalInfo` component is a container that centers its child elements and provides padding and margin. It can be used to display information in a modal dialog box. \n\nThe `TextDot` component is a small dot with a height and width of 3 pixels and a border radius of 50%. It can be used as a bullet point or to indicate a selected item. \n\nThe `FadedSpan` component is a text element with a font size of 14 pixels. It can be used to display text that is less important than other content on the page. \n\nThe `Checkbox` component is an input element styled to have a height of 20 pixels and no margin. It can be used to create checkboxes in forms. \n\nThe `PaddedColumn` component is a container with 20 pixels of padding. It can be used to create columns of content with consistent spacing. \n\nThe `MenuItem` component is a container with a height of 56 pixels and a grid layout that can be used to display menu items. It has four columns, with the second column taking up the remaining space. \n\nThe `SearchInput` component is an input element styled to have a padding of 16 pixels and a border radius of 10 pixels. It can be used to create search bars or input fields. \n\nThe `Separator` and `SeparatorDark` components are horizontal lines with a height of 1 pixel. They can be used to separate content on a page. \n\nOverall, this file provides a set of reusable styled components that can be used to create consistent UI elements across the project. By using these components, developers can save time and ensure that the project has a consistent look and feel. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { ModalInfo, TextDot, Checkbox } from 'zoo'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <ModalInfo>\n      <TextDot />\n      <Checkbox type=\"checkbox\" />\n    </ModalInfo>\n  )\n}\n```",
