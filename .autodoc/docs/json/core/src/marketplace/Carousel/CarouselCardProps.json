  "summary": "The code above defines an interface called `CarouselCardProps` that is exported as the default export of the file. This interface is generic, meaning that it can be used with any type `T`. \n\nThe interface has several properties. The first property is called `element` and is of type `T`. This property is used to store the data that will be displayed in the carousel card. The second property is called `height` and is of type `number`. This property is used to set the height of the carousel card. \n\nThe third property is called `handleElementSelected` and is an optional function that takes an argument of type `T` and returns `void`. This function is used to handle the event when the user selects an element in the carousel. If this property is not provided, nothing will happen when the user selects an element. \n\nThe fourth property is called `classNameOuter` and is an optional string. This property is used to set the class name of the outer container of the carousel card. If this property is not provided, the default class name will be used. \n\nThis interface is likely used in the larger project to define the props that are passed to the `CarouselCard` component. The `CarouselCard` component is likely a reusable component that displays data in a carousel format. By defining the props using this interface, the component can be used with any type of data and can be customized with different heights and class names. \n\nExample usage of this interface:\n\n```\nimport CarouselCardProps from './CarouselCardProps'\n\ninterface Animal {\n  name: string\n  species: string\n  image: string\n}\n\nconst animal: Animal = {\n  name: 'Lion',\n  species: 'Panthera leo',\n  image: 'https://example.com/lion.jpg'\n}\n\nconst props: CarouselCardProps<Animal> = {\n  element: animal,\n  height: 200,\n  handleElementSelected: (selectedAnimal) => console.log(`Selected ${selectedAnimal.name}`),\n  classNameOuter: 'carousel-card-outer'\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CarouselCardProps` interface?\n   - The `CarouselCardProps` interface is used to define the props that are required for a carousel card component. It includes properties such as the element to be displayed, the height of the card, and an optional callback function for when the element is selected.\n\n2. Why is the `aspectRatio` property commented out?\n   - It is unclear why the `aspectRatio` property is commented out. It may have been removed from the interface due to changes in the design or functionality of the carousel card component.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `classNameOuter` property?\n   - The `classNameOuter` property is an optional property that allows developers to add a custom class name to the outer container of the carousel card component. This can be useful for styling or targeting specific instances of the component.",
