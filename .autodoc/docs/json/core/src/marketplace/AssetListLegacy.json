  "summary": "The `AssetList` component is a React component that renders a paginated list of assets. It receives a set of props that define the type of assets to display, the number of assets to display per page, and whether to animate the assets or not. It also receives a callback function that is called when the assets are loaded.\n\nThe component uses the `useContract` hook to get a reference to a smart contract called `Drop`. It then uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch the total number of minted tokens for the given token name. Once the total number of minted tokens is fetched, the component calculates the first token ID and the total number of pages based on the number of tokens per page. It then uses the `getPaginatedAssets` function to fetch the assets for the current page and updates the state of the component with the new assets.\n\nThe `getPaginatedAssets` function takes the type of assets, the first token ID, the total number of minted tokens, the current page number, and the number of tokens per page as arguments. It calculates the start and end token IDs for the current page and returns an object that contains the assets for the current page, the start and end token IDs, the total number of pages, and the type of assets.\n\nThe component renders a header that displays the type of assets and the current page number. It also renders a list of assets that are passed as props to the `Asset` component. The `Asset` component is responsible for rendering a single asset and receives a set of props that define the asset to display.\n\nThe component also renders a pagination control that allows the user to navigate between pages. The pagination control consists of two buttons that allow the user to navigate to the previous or next page. The buttons are disabled if the user is on the first or last page, respectively.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\n<AssetList\n  tokenType=\"NFT\"\n  tokenName=\"MyNFT\"\n  autoPlay={true}\n  animate={true}\n  large={true}\n  onLoadAssets={(assets) => console.log(assets)}\n/>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useContract` hook from the `../hooks` module?\n- A smart developer might ask what the `useContract` hook does and what it is used for. This hook is likely used to interact with a smart contract on the blockchain.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `getPaginatedAssets` function and how is it used?\n- A smart developer might ask about the `getPaginatedAssets` function and how it is used. This function is used to retrieve a paginated list of assets based on the provided parameters such as `type`, `firstTokenId`, `totalMinted`, `page`, and `perPage`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `autoPlay` and `animate` props in the `AssetList` component?\n- A smart developer might ask about the `autoPlay` and `animate` props in the `AssetList` component and what they are used for. These props are likely used to control the behavior of the assets displayed in the component, such as whether they should automatically play or animate.",
