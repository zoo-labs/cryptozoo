  "summary": "The code is a React component that exports a button component called `LazyRemoveBidButton`. This button is used to remove a bid for a specific token. The component takes in several props including `dropId`, `name`, `currency`, `onError`, and `onRemove`. \n\nThe `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to get the current user's account. The `useGasPrice` hook is used to get the current gas price. The `useContract` hook is used to get the `App` and `Media` contracts. The `useTransactionPopups` hook is used to add transaction and error popups.\n\nThe `removeBid` function is a callback function that is called when the button is clicked. It first tries to remove the bid using the `app.removeLazyBid` function. If the currency is native, it will use the `app` contract to remove the bid. Otherwise, it will use the `media` contract to remove the bid. If the bid is successfully removed, the `onRemove` function is called. If there is an error, the `onError` function is called.\n\nThe `LazyRemoveBidButton` component returns a button with the text \"Remove Bid\". When the button is clicked, the `removeBid` function is called. The button has a red background and turns indigo when hovered over. \n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that involves bidding on tokens. When a user wants to remove their bid, they can click the `LazyRemoveBidButton` component and the bid will be removed. The `onRemove` function can be used to update the UI to reflect that the bid has been removed. The `onError` function can be used to display an error message if there is an error removing the bid.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `LazyRemoveBidButton` component?\n- The `LazyRemoveBidButton` component is a button that, when clicked, removes a bid for a specific token ID.\n\n2. What external libraries or packages are being imported in this file?\n- The file is importing functions from \"@zoolabs/zdk\", \"react\", and \"../hooks\", as well as components from \"../state/network/hooks\" and \"../state/transactions/hooks\".\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useCallback` hook in this code?\n- The `useCallback` hook is used to define the `removeBid` function, which is an asynchronous function that removes a bid for a specific token ID. It is memoized to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the component.",
