  "summary": "The `BidItem` component is a React component that renders a single bid item. It takes in a `bid` object, which contains information about the bid, such as the bidder, the amount, and the currency used. It also takes in some optional props, such as `showToken`, `summary`, and `onClick`, which determine how the bid item is displayed and what actions can be taken on it.\n\nThe component first imports various dependencies, such as icons, tokens, and hooks, that are used throughout the component. It then defines the `BidProps` type, which specifies the shape of the `bid` object and the optional props.\n\nThe `BidItem` component then defines its state using the `useState` hook. It keeps track of the formatted amount of the bid and the currency token used. It also uses the `useEffect` hook to update the currency token when the `chainId` changes.\n\nThe component then renders the bid item using JSX. It displays information about the bid, such as the bidder, the bid amount, and the currency used. It also displays a token ID if `showToken` is true. Additionally, it displays a time ago timestamp and an eye icon if `onClick` is defined.\n\nOverall, the `BidItem` component is a reusable component that can be used to display a single bid item in a larger project. It takes in a `bid` object and optional props to customize its display and functionality. It uses various dependencies and hooks to manage its state and render the bid item. Here is an example usage of the `BidItem` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport BidItem from './BidItem'\n\nconst bid = {\n  bidder: {\n    id: '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890'\n  },\n  amount: '1000000000000000000',\n  currency: {\n    id: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n  },\n  media: {\n    contentURI: 'ipfs://Qm...'\n  },\n  createdAtTimestamp: '1620000000'\n}\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <BidItem bid={bid} showToken={true} summary=\"placed a bid\" onClick={(bid) => console.log(bid)} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
