  "summary": "The code above is a React component called `MarketHero` that renders a two-column layout with a `WelcomeCard` component on the left and a `HomeCard` component on the right. The `TwoColumComp` component is imported from the `../Grid/TwoColumComp` file and is used to create the two-column layout. The `AddClass` prop is used to add a margin-top of 5 pixels on small screens and 1 pixel on large screens.\n\nThe `WelcomeCard` and `HomeCard` components are imported from their respective files and are used as the content for the left and right columns, respectively. These components are likely to contain information about the zoo, such as its history, mission, and featured animals.\n\nThe `MarketHero` component is exported as the default export of the file, which means it can be imported and used in other files within the project. For example, it could be used in the homepage of the zoo's website to showcase important information about the zoo and its offerings.\n\nHere is an example of how the `MarketHero` component could be used in a hypothetical `HomePage` component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport MarketHero from './MarketHero'\n\nconst HomePage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <MarketHero />\n      {/* other content */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default HomePage\n```\n\nOverall, the `MarketHero` component serves as a reusable and flexible way to display important information about the zoo in a visually appealing way.",
