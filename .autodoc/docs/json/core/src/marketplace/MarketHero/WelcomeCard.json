  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `WelcomeCard` that renders a card with a title, subtitle, and two buttons. The component takes two props, `tittle` and `subtittle`, which default to some placeholder text but can be overridden to display custom text. The card has a fixed height and width, with larger dimensions on larger screens.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display a welcome message or call-to-action on a landing page or other prominent location. The `tittle` and `subtittle` props can be used to customize the text displayed on the card, while the buttons can be linked to other parts of the application or external resources.\n\nHere is an example of how the `WelcomeCard` component could be used in a React application:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport WelcomeCard from './WelcomeCard'\n\nconst HomePage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <WelcomeCard\n        tittle=\"Welcome to the ZOO\"\n        subtittle=\"The best place to buy and sell NFTs\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default HomePage\n```\n\nIn this example, the `WelcomeCard` component is used on the `HomePage` component to display a welcome message with custom text. The `tittle` and `subtittle` props are passed in to override the default placeholder text. The buttons on the card could be linked to other parts of the application, such as a marketplace or gallery of NFTs.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this component?\n   This component is a WelcomeCard that displays a main title, subtitle, and two buttons for buying and exploring ZOO NFTs.\n\n2. What props can be passed to this component?\n   The component accepts two optional props: \"tittle\" (which sets the main title text) and \"subtittle\" (which sets the subtitle text).\n\n3. What is the significance of the CSS classes used in this component?\n   The CSS classes are used to style the component's layout and appearance. The classes with the \"h-\" prefix set the height of the elements, while the classes with the \"w-\" prefix set the width. The \"p-\" class sets padding, and the \"m-\" class sets margin. The \"text-\" class sets the font size, and the \"border\" class sets a border around the button elements.",
