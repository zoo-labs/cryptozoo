  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `HowReservations`. This component renders a section of text that explains how reservations work for the LUX network launch. The component takes a single prop called `onClick`, which is a function that will be called when the \"Ok\" button is clicked.\n\nThe component returns a div element with a class of \"m-auto w-96\", which centers the content horizontally and sets a fixed width of 96 pixels. Inside the div, there is an h2 element with a class of \"mb-6 text-xl\", which sets the font size to extra large and adds a margin bottom of 6 units. This element displays the heading \"How do reservations work?\".\n\nBelow the heading, there is a p element with a class of \"mb-10\", which sets a margin bottom of 10 units. This element displays the text \"Reserve your NFT to ensure you are part of the LUX network at launch. If your bid is not accepted, your reservation will be refunded.\".\n\nFinally, there is a button element with a type of \"button\" and a class that sets various styles for the button. The button displays the text \"Ok\". When the button is clicked, the `onClick` function passed as a prop will be called.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to display information about how reservations work for the LUX network launch. It can be included in a page or modal that allows users to make reservations and provides them with information about the process. Here is an example of how the component can be used:\n\n```\nimport HowReservations from './HowReservations';\n\nfunction ReservationPage() {\n  function handleOkClick() {\n    // Handle the \"Ok\" button click\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Make a Reservation</h1>\n      <HowReservations onClick={handleOkClick} />\n      {/* Other reservation form elements */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
