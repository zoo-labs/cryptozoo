  "summary": "The `CollectionTable` component is a reusable React component that renders a table with customizable column titles. It takes in several props, including `TitleA` through `TitleF`, which are used to set the titles of the corresponding columns in the table. If any of these props are not provided, default titles are used instead. The `TitleMain` prop is used to set the main title of the table, which is rendered above the table itself.\n\nThe component renders a `div` element with a class of `w-full bg-transparent min-h-[800px]`, which sets the width and minimum height of the table. Inside this `div`, there is an `h3` element that displays the `TitleMain` prop. Below this, there is a `table` element with a class of `w-full rounded-2xl p-2`, which sets the width, border radius, and padding of the table.\n\nThe `thead` element contains a single row with seven columns, each of which corresponds to a column in the table. The `th` elements inside each column display the corresponding title, which is either the value of the corresponding prop or a default value if the prop is not provided. The `tbody` element contains the actual content of the table, which is passed in as the `children` prop.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project whenever a table with customizable column titles is needed. For example, it could be used to display a list of animals in a zoo, with each column representing a different attribute of the animals (e.g. name, species, habitat, etc.). The `CollectionTable` component could be reused throughout the project wherever a similar table is needed, with different props passed in to customize the column titles and content. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport CollectionTable from './CollectionTable'\n\nconst animals = [\n  { name: 'Lion', species: 'Panthera leo', habitat: 'Savannah' },\n  { name: 'Giraffe', species: 'Giraffa camelopardalis', habitat: 'Grasslands' },\n  { name: 'Elephant', species: 'Loxodonta africana', habitat: 'Forests' },\n  // ...\n]\n\nconst AnimalTable = () => {\n  return (\n    <CollectionTable\n      TitleA=\"Name\"\n      TitleB=\"Species\"\n      TitleC=\"Habitat\"\n      TitleMain=\"Animals in the Zoo\"\n    >\n      {animals.map(animal => (\n        <tr key={animal.name}>\n          <td>{animal.name}</td>\n          <td>{animal.species}</td>\n          <td>{animal.habitat}</td>\n        </tr>\n      ))}\n    </CollectionTable>\n  )\n}\n```",
