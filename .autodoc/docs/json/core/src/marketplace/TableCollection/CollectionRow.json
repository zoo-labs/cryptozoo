  "summary": "The `CollectionRow` component is a reusable React component that renders a table row with six columns. The purpose of this component is to provide a consistent layout for displaying data in a table format. The component takes in six optional props (`ColARank`, `ColA`, `ColB`, `ColC`, `ColD`, and `ColE`) that can be used to customize the content of each column. If a prop is not provided, a default value is used.\n\nThe component uses the `tr` and `td` HTML tags to create the table row and columns, respectively. The `className` attribute is used to apply CSS classes to each element, which control the styling of the table. The `flex` class is used to make the first column (`ColARank`) and the second column (`ColA`) appear side-by-side.\n\nHere is an example of how the `CollectionRow` component can be used:\n\n```\nimport CollectionRow from './CollectionRow'\n\nfunction MyTable() {\n  return (\n    <table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Rank</th>\n          <th>Column A</th>\n          <th>Column B</th>\n          <th>Column C</th>\n          <th>Column D</th>\n          <th>Column E</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n        <CollectionRow\n          ColARank=\"1\"\n          ColA=\"Data 1\"\n          ColB=\"Data 2\"\n          ColC=\"Data 3\"\n          ColD=\"Data 4\"\n          ColE=\"Data 5\"\n          ColF=\"Data 6\"\n        />\n        <CollectionRow\n          ColARank=\"2\"\n          ColA=\"Data 7\"\n          ColB=\"Data 8\"\n          ColC=\"Data 9\"\n          ColD=\"Data 10\"\n          ColE=\"Data 11\"\n          ColF=\"Data 12\"\n        />\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CollectionRow` component is used to render two rows of data in a table. The `ColARank`, `ColA`, `ColB`, `ColC`, `ColD`, `ColE`, and `ColF` props are used to customize the content of each column. The resulting table will have a consistent layout and styling, making it easier to read and understand the data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a React component called `CollectionRow` that renders a table row with cells that can be customized using props.\n\n2. What are the default values for the props used in this component?\n   - The default values for the props are: `ColARank` is `'1'`, `ColA` is `'Use Prop \"ColA\" To Change '`, `ColB` is `'Use Prop \"ColB\" To Change '`, `ColC` is `'Use Prop \"ColC\" To Change '`, `ColD` is `'Use Prop \"ColD\" To Change '`, `ColE` is `'Use Prop \"ColC\" To Change'`, and `ColF` is `'Use Prop \"ColF\" To Change'`.\n\n3. What CSS classes are applied to the table cells in this component?\n   - The table cells have the following CSS classes applied to them: `text-xs md:text-base  text-left`, `bg-[#1F2030]`, `p-4`, `border-b`, and `border-opacity-5`. The first cell in each row also has the additional classes `col-span-2` and `flex`, and the first div inside that cell has the class `w-1/4`.",
