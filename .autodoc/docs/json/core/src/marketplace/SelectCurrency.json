  "summary": "The code above is a React component that renders a list of supported payment currencies for a given blockchain network. It imports the `useActiveWeb3React` hook from a `hooks` module and the `getSupportedPaymentCurrencies` function from a `config/currencies` module. It also imports a `CurrencyLogo` component from a local file.\n\nThe `SelectCurrency` component takes a single prop called `onSelect`, which is a callback function that will be called when a currency is selected. The component first calls the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the current blockchain network's ID. It then renders a list of buttons, each representing a supported currency for the current network. The list is generated by mapping over the result of calling `getSupportedPaymentCurrencies` with the current network's ID as an argument.\n\nEach button has an `onClick` handler that calls the `onSelect` callback with the selected currency as an argument. The button also renders a `CurrencyLogo` component and the currency symbol in a `div` element. The `CurrencyLogo` component takes the currency symbol as a prop and renders the corresponding logo.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that requires users to select a payment currency for a transaction. The `onSelect` callback can be used to update the selected currency in the parent component's state or trigger an action. The `getSupportedPaymentCurrencies` function can be modified to support additional blockchain networks or currencies. The `CurrencyLogo` component can be reused in other parts of the project that require currency logos. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport SelectCurrency from './SelectCurrency'\n\nconst PaymentForm = () => {\n  const [selectedCurrency, setSelectedCurrency] = useState(null)\n\n  const handleCurrencySelect = (currency) => {\n    setSelectedCurrency(currency)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <SelectCurrency onSelect={handleCurrencySelect} />\n      <p>Selected currency: {selectedCurrency ? selectedCurrency.symbol : 'None'}</p>\n      {/* rest of payment form */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SelectCurrency` component?\n   - The `SelectCurrency` component is used to display a list of supported payment currencies and allow the user to select one.\n2. Where is the `useActiveWeb3React` hook imported from?\n   - The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is imported from a file located in the `../hooks` directory.\n3. What is the structure of the data returned by the `getSupportedPaymentCurrencies` function?\n   - The `getSupportedPaymentCurrencies` function returns an array of currency objects, each with a `symbol` property.",
