  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `InfinityLoader`. This component is responsible for rendering an animated infinity symbol that is used to indicate that a transaction is pending. The component takes in three optional props: `alt`, `height`, and `width`. \n\nThe `Image` component is imported from the `../components/Image` file. This component is likely a custom implementation of the standard HTML `img` tag that allows for more flexibility and customization. \n\nThe `InfinityLoader` component returns an instance of the `Image` component with the `src` prop set to the path of an animated infinity symbol. The `alt`, `height`, and `width` props are passed through to the `Image` component, allowing for customization of the rendered image.\n\nThis component is likely used in various places throughout the larger project to indicate that a transaction is pending. For example, it may be used in a payment processing flow to indicate that a payment is being processed and the user should wait for confirmation. \n\nHere is an example of how the `InfinityLoader` component may be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { InfinityLoader } from 'zoo';\n\nconst PaymentProcessing = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Processing Payment</h2>\n      <p>Please wait while we process your payment...</p>\n      <InfinityLoader alt=\"Payment Processing\" height={64} width={64} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default PaymentProcessing;\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `InfinityLoader` component is used to indicate that a payment is being processed. The `alt` prop is set to \"Payment Processing\" and the `height` and `width` props are set to 64 to increase the size of the rendered image.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Image` component being imported?\n   - The `Image` component is being imported from a file located at `../components/Image`. It is likely used to display images within the application.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `InfinityLoader` function?\n   - The `InfinityLoader` function returns an `Image` component with a default source of `/animated-infinity.svg` and customizable `alt`, `height`, and `width` props. It is likely used as a loading animation for pending transactions.\n\n3. What type of file is this code located in?\n   - The code is located in a file located at `zoo`. It is unclear what type of file it is without further context.",
