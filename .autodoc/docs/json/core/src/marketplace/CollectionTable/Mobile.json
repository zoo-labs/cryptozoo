  "summary": "The `CollectionTableMobile` component is a React component that renders a table row for a given collection. The component takes a `collection` prop, which is an object that contains information about the collection to be displayed. The component is designed to be used in a mobile view of a larger project, where the table is displayed in a vertical format.\n\nThe component renders a row with the collection index, an image, and some information about the collection. The image is displayed using an `img` tag with a source of `/icons/col.webp`. The information about the collection is displayed in a nested `div` element. The information includes the name of the collection, the floor price, and the 24-hour volume. If the user clicks on a button, additional information about the collection is displayed, including the total volume, the number of owners, and the number of items in the collection.\n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of whether the additional information is displayed or not. The `showMobileFull` state variable is initialized to `false`, and is toggled when the user clicks on the button to show or hide the additional information.\n\nThe component is designed to be used as a child component of a larger table component, where each row of the table is a `CollectionTableMobile` component. The component is responsive and is designed to be used in a mobile view of the table. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport CollectionTableMobile from './CollectionTableMobile'\n\nconst collections = [\n  { index: 1, name: 'Terraforms', floorPrice: 0.46, volume24h: 9615.25, totalVolume: 3615978.25, owners: 3615, items: 9654 },\n  { index: 2, name: 'CryptoKitties', floorPrice: 0.1, volume24h: 1234.56, totalVolume: 987654.32, owners: 123, items: 456 },\n  // ...\n]\n\nconst CollectionTable = () => {\n  return (\n    <table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Index</th>\n          <th>Name</th>\n          <th>Floor Price</th>\n          <th>24h Volume</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n        {collections.map((collection) => (\n          <tr key={collection.index}>\n            <CollectionTableMobile collection={collection} />\n          </tr>\n        ))}\n      </tbody>\n    </table>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default CollectionTable\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CollectionTableMobile` component?\n- The `CollectionTableMobile` component is a React component that renders a table of data for a given collection.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `showMobileFull` state variable?\n- The `showMobileFull` state variable is used to toggle the display of additional data in the table when the user clicks on a button.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `eslint-disable` comment at the top of the file?\n- The `eslint-disable` comment is used to disable a specific ESLint rule (`@next/next/no-img-element`) for this file, which prevents ESLint from throwing an error when the `img` element is used without a `src` attribute.",
