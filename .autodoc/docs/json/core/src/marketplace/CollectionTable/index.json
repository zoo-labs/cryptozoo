  "summary": "The `CollectionTable` component is a React component that renders a table of collections. It takes in a prop called `collections`, which is an array of objects representing each collection. The component is used to display information about each collection, including the collection name, floor, 24-hour volume, total volume, owner, and number of items.\n\nThe component is divided into two parts: a desktop view and a mobile view. The desktop view is rendered when the screen size is larger than `md` (768px). It displays a table with the collection information. The mobile view is rendered when the screen size is smaller than `md`. It displays a list of collections using the `CollectionTableMobile` component.\n\nThe table is created using HTML `table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, and `th` elements. The `thead` contains the table header, which includes the column names. The `tbody` contains the table rows, which are created using the `collections` prop. The `collections` prop is mapped over using the `map` function to create a row for each collection. The `key` prop is set to the index of the collection in the array. The `td` elements contain the collection information.\n\nThe `Image` component is used to display an image of the collection icon. It takes in the `src`, `alt`, `width`, and `height` props. The `src` prop is set to the path of the image file. The `alt` prop is set to an empty string. The `width` and `height` props are set to `40`.\n\nThe `CollectionTableMobile` component is used to display the collection information in the mobile view. It takes in a prop called `collection`, which is an object representing the collection. The `index` prop is set to the index of the collection in the array plus one.\n\nOverall, the `CollectionTable` component is a reusable component that can be used to display a table of collections in a React application. It is responsive and can be used on both desktop and mobile devices.",
