  "summary": "The `InfoComp` component is a React component that displays a carousel of information cards. The component imports the `useState` hook from the `react` library, the `Slider` component from the `react-slick` library, and the `Image` component from the `next/image` library. It also imports two CSS files for styling the carousel.\n\nThe component defines an array of objects called `data`, where each object represents an information card. Each card has an `id`, a `title`, a `description`, and an `image`. The component also defines a `settings` object that configures the behavior of the `Slider` component.\n\nThe `return` statement of the component renders the carousel using the `Slider` component. The `Slider` component iterates over the `data` array and renders an information card for each object in the array. Each card is a `div` element that contains two child `div` elements. The first child `div` element contains the `title` and `description` of the card, and the second child `div` element contains the `image` of the card. The `Image` component is used to display the image, and its `src`, `width`, `height`, and `alt` attributes are set using the `image` property of the current object in the `data` array.\n\nThe `Slider` component is also configured to display navigation dots and to allow infinite scrolling. The component also defines two buttons that allow the user to navigate to the previous or next card in the carousel. These buttons are displayed at the bottom of the carousel and are only visible when the user hovers over them.\n\nThe `InfoComp` component can be used in a larger project to display a carousel of information cards. The `data` array can be customized to include different cards with different titles, descriptions, and images. The `settings` object can also be customized to change the behavior of the carousel. The component can be styled using CSS to match the design of the larger project. An example usage of the `InfoComp` component is shown below:\n\n```\nimport InfoComp from './InfoComp'\n\nconst HomePage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo!</h1>\n      <InfoComp />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default HomePage\n```",
