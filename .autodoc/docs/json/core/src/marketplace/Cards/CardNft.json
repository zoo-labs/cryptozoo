  "summary": "The `CardNft` component is a React component that renders a card displaying information about a specific NFT (non-fungible token) auction. The component takes in several props, including the `nft` prop, which is an object containing information about the NFT auction, such as its name, animation URL, reserve price, and highest bid. \n\nThe component first renders a container div with a minimum width and height, and a flex layout that centers its child elements. Within this container, the component renders a video or 3D model of the NFT, depending on the `kind` property of the `nft` object. If the `kind` is 0 or 2, a video is rendered using the `animation_url` property of the `nft` object. Otherwise, a 3D model is rendered using the `glb_animation_url` and `usdz_animation_url` properties of the `nft` object.\n\nIf the `showDetails` prop is true, the component also renders additional information about the NFT auction, including the NFT's name, reserve price, highest bid, and yield per day. The reserve price is displayed as a button that links to the marketplace page for the corresponding animal NFT. The highest bid and yield per day are displayed as text.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to display information about NFT auctions in a visually appealing way. It can be used in conjunction with other components to create a marketplace or auction page for animal NFTs. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport CardNft from \"path/to/CardNft\";\n\nconst nft = {\n  name: \"Giraffe NFT\",\n  kind: 1,\n  glb_animation_url: \"path/to/giraffe.glb\",\n  usdz_animation_url: \"path/to/giraffe.usdz\",\n  reservePrice: 1000000,\n  amount: 500000,\n  duration: 86400,\n  tokenOwner: \"0x1234567890abcdef\",\n  attributes: [\n    { trait_type: \"Yields\", value: \"10\" },\n    { trait_type: \"Color\", value: \"Brown\" },\n  ],\n};\n\nfunction AuctionPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Giraffe NFT Auction</h1>\n      <CardNft nft={nft} className=\"my-4\" />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
