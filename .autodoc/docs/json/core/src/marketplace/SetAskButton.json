  "summary": "The code is a React component called `SetAskButton` that allows a user to set an asking price for a specific token. The component takes in several props including `tokenId`, `tokenType`, `amount`, `currencyToken`, and `offline`. \n\nThe component first imports several dependencies including `Currency` from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, `ethers` from the `ethers` library, and several custom hooks from the `../hooks` and `../state` directories. \n\nThe `SetAskButton` component then defines a function called `setAsk` that is called when the user clicks the \"Set Ask\" button. This function first checks if an `amount` has been provided and if so, creates an `Ask` object with the provided `amount`, `currencyToken`, and `offline` status. The `amount` is converted to the appropriate units using the `ethers.utils.parseUnits` function. The `media` contract is then used to set the ask for the specified `tokenId` with the `ask` object and the `account` and `gasPrice` values. If successful, a transaction popup is added to the state using the `addTransactionPopup` function. If an error occurs, an error popup is added to the state using the `addErrorPopup` function.\n\nFinally, the component returns a button element with the text \"Set Ask\" that calls the `setAsk` function when clicked. The button has several CSS classes applied to it for styling purposes.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that involves buying and selling tokens. It allows users to set an asking price for their tokens, which can then be viewed by potential buyers. The component can be integrated into a larger UI that displays a user's tokens and allows them to manage their asking prices. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<SetAskButton \n  tokenId={123} \n  tokenType=\"NFT\" \n  amount={1.5} \n  currencyToken={Currency.ETH} \n  offline={false} \n/>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `SetAskButton` component?\n- The `SetAskButton` component is used to set an asking price for a specific token.\n\n2. What external libraries or packages are being imported in this file?\n- The file is importing `Currency` from `@zoolabs/zdk`, `ethers` from `ethers`, and `useCallback`, `useActiveWeb3React`, and `useContract` from custom `../hooks` files, as well as `useGasPrice` from `../state/network/hooks` and `useTransactionPopups` from `../state/transactions/hooks`.\n\n3. What happens if the `amount` parameter is not provided in the `SetAskButton` props?\n- If the `amount` parameter is not provided, a \"todo\" message is logged to the console.",
