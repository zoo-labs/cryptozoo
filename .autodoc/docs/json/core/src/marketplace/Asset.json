  "summary": "The `Asset` component is a React component that renders an asset, which can be an image or a video, along with some metadata such as the asset type, token ID, and price information. The component takes in several props, including the `tokenId` and `contentURI` of the asset, as well as optional `ask` and `highest` bid information, `formattedAmount`, `usdAmount`, and `symbol` for displaying the price, and various other optional props for styling and functionality.\n\nThe component uses several hooks and functions from other files in the project, such as `useActiveWeb3React` and `getContent`, to retrieve and display the necessary information. It also conditionally renders either an image or a video based on the `large` prop, and includes an overlay with the asset metadata and price information.\n\nIf the `showPrice` prop is true and there is bid information available, the component will display the highest bid amount and bidder, along with an option to view the bid details. If there is no bid information available, the component will simply display the asset price.\n\nOverall, the `Asset` component is a reusable component that can be used to display and sell assets in the larger project. It provides a clean and customizable interface for displaying asset information and price, and can be easily integrated with other components and functionality in the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\n<Asset tokenId={123} contentURI=\"https://example.com/image.jpg\" showPrice={true} formattedAmount=\"1.23\" symbol=\"ETH\" />\n```",
