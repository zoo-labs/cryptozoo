  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `EarnCard` that renders a card with a heading and subtext. The component takes two props, `heading` and `subText`, which are both optional and have default values. If no values are provided, the heading will be \"Main Heading\" and the subtext will be a placeholder string.\n\nThe component returns a div element with a fixed width and height, a transparent background, and a gray border. Inside the div, there are three child elements: two divs and a paragraph. The first div is empty and has a fixed height of 50 pixels. The second div contains an h1 element with the value of the `heading` prop. The third div contains a p element with the value of the `subText` prop.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display information in a card format. The `heading` prop can be used to provide a title for the card, while the `subText` prop can be used to provide additional details or a description. The component's fixed width and height make it suitable for use in a grid or other layout where consistent sizing is desired.\n\nHere is an example of how the `EarnCard` component could be used in a larger React application:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport EarnCard from './EarnCard'\n\nconst App = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container mx-auto\">\n      <h1 className=\"text-2xl font-bold mb-4\">Earn Rewards</h1>\n      <div className=\"grid grid-cols-3 gap-4\">\n        <EarnCard heading=\"Complete Surveys\" subText=\"Earn points by completing surveys.\" />\n        <EarnCard heading=\"Watch Videos\" subText=\"Watch videos to earn points.\" />\n        <EarnCard heading=\"Refer Friends\" subText=\"Refer friends to earn bonus points.\" />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default App\n```\n\nIn this example, the `EarnCard` component is used three times to display different ways to earn rewards. The component's fixed size and consistent layout make it easy to create a grid of cards that look good together. The `heading` and `subText` props are used to customize the content of each card.",
