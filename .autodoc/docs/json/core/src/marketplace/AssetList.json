  "summary": "The `AssetList` component is a React component that renders a list of assets. It takes in various props such as `title`, `tokenType`, `tokenName`, `totalMinted`, `perPage`, `cols`, `where`, `orderBy`, `className`, `autoPlay`, `showPageNumbers`, `animate`, `large`, `empty`, `getTriggerProps`, `onLoadAssets`, and `openModal`. \n\nThe component uses the `useQuery` hook from the `@apollo/client` library to fetch data from a GraphQL API. The GraphQL query is defined in the `GET_ASSETS` constant and retrieves a list of assets based on the `where`, `skip`, `first`, and `orderBy` variables. The `where` variable is an object that can contain filters such as `owner`, `contentURI_contains`, and `metadataURI_contains`. The `skip` variable is used to skip a certain number of assets, while the `first` variable is used to limit the number of assets returned. The `orderBy` variable is used to specify the order in which the assets are returned.\n\nThe `AssetList` component also uses various React hooks such as `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useCallback` to manage state and handle events. The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the `totalPages`, `assets`, `page`, and `pageOffset` variables. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `totalPages` variable whenever the `totalMinted` prop changes, and to update the `assets` variable whenever the data is fetched from the GraphQL API. The `useCallback` hook is used to define the `previousPage` and `nextPage` functions, which are used to navigate between pages of assets.\n\nThe `AssetList` component renders a list of `Asset` components, passing in various props such as `tokenId`, `contentURI`, `showPrice`, `animate`, `large`, and `onClick`. The `Asset` component is defined in a separate file and renders an individual asset.\n\nOverall, the `AssetList` component is a reusable component that can be used to render a list of assets in various parts of the larger project. It provides various props and options to customize the rendering of the assets, such as the number of assets per page, the order in which the assets are displayed, and whether to show page numbers or not.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AssetList` component?\n- The `AssetList` component is used to display a list of assets with pagination and filtering options.\n\n2. What external libraries or APIs does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries and APIs, including React, react-morphing-modal, lodash, Apollo Client, Next.js, and ethers.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useContract` and `useTokenTypes` hooks?\n- The `useContract` hook is likely used to interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, while the `useTokenTypes` hook is likely used to manage state related to different types of tokens. However, without more context it is difficult to say for certain.",
