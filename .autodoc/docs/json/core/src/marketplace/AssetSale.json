  "summary": "The `AssetSale` component is a React component that renders a visual representation of an asset for sale, along with information about the asset and its current bid status. The component takes in various props that define the asset being sold, such as its name, content URI, and highest bid. \n\nThe component uses several other components and hooks to render the asset and its information. The `ModelViewer` component is used to display a 3D model of the asset, while the `getContent` function is used to extract information about the asset from its content URI. The `useActiveWeb3React` and `useContract` hooks are used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and retrieve information about the asset's bid status and token type.\n\nThe component also includes logic for handling bids on the asset. When a user clicks on the \"EyeIcon\" button, the `onClickBid` function is called, which in turn calls the `props.onClickBid` function if it exists. This function is passed a `GraphBid` object that contains information about the bid, such as the bidder's ID and the bid amount.\n\nOverall, the `AssetSale` component is a key part of the larger project's functionality for buying and selling assets on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a user-friendly interface for viewing and bidding on assets, and integrates with other components and hooks to provide a seamless user experience. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\n<AssetSale\n  dropId={1}\n  name=\"My Asset\"\n  glb=\"https://example.com/my-asset.glb\"\n  contentURI=\"https://example.com/my-asset.json\"\n  metadataURI=\"https://example.com/my-asset-metadata.json\"\n  ask={{ amount: 100, currency: 'ETH' }}\n  formattedAmount=\"1.23\"\n  usdAmount=\"123.45\"\n  symbol=\"ETH\"\n  highest={{ bid: { amount: 2, bidder: { id: '0x123abc' } } }}\n  className=\"my-asset-sale\"\n  height={400}\n  width={400}\n  showPrice={true}\n  isOwner={false}\n  autoPlay={false}\n  animate={true}\n  large={false}\n  getUsdAmount={(tokenAddress, tokenAmount) => '123.45'}\n  onClickBid={(bid) => console.log('Clicked bid:', bid)}\n  onClickTokenType={(name, glb) => console.log('Clicked token type:', name, glb)}\n/>\n```",
