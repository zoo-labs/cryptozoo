  "summary": "The `AssetModal` component is a React component that renders a modal window displaying information about a specific asset. It imports several other components and hooks from various files in the project, including `AssetSale`, `HowReservations`, `SetSaleBid`, `LazySetAsk`, `HowOffline`, `LazyBidList`, `LazyBidModal`, and `Web3Connect`. \n\nThe component receives several props, including `modalProps` which contains the properties of the modal window, and `dropId` which is used to identify the asset. The component uses the `useRouter` hook from the `next/router` module to get the current router object, and the `useActiveWeb3React` hook from the `hooks` module to get the current active Web3 provider. \n\nThe component defines a `defaultShow` object that contains boolean values for several sections of the modal window, and two helper components `NoBids` and `NoAsks` that display messages when there are no bids or asks for the asset. \n\nThe component defines a `showSection` function that sets the `show` state to display a specific section of the modal window. It also defines an `onClose` function that navigates back to the previous page and closes the modal window. \n\nThe component defines a `onClickBid` function that sets the `modalBid` state to the selected bid and toggles the `showBidModal` state to display the bid modal window. \n\nThe component uses the `useTokenType` hook from the `state` module to get information about the asset, including the `ask`, `highest`, `getUsdAmount`, `contentURI`, `metadataURI`, `formattedAmount`, `isOwner`, `symbol`, and `usdAmount`. It also uses the `useState` hook to define several states, including `tokenId`, `show`, `showBidModal`, and `modalBid`. \n\nThe component renders a `LazyBidModal` component that displays the bid modal window, passing in the `dropId`, `name`, `bid`, `isOpen`, and `onClose` props. It also renders a `Modal` component from the `react-morphing-modal` module that displays the main modal window, passing in the `modalProps` prop. \n\nThe component renders two `div` elements side by side, one displaying the asset information and the other displaying the bids and asks for the asset. The first `div` contains a `div` element that displays a back button, and a `div` element that displays the `AssetSale` component, passing in several props including the `ask`, `dropId`, `name`, `contentURI`, `metadataURI`, `formattedAmount`, `usdAmount`, `getUsdAmount`, `highest`, `symbol`, `isOwner`, `showPrice`, `large`, and `onClickBid`. \n\nThe second `div` contains a `div` element that displays either the `HowOffline` component or the `LazySetAsk` component depending on whether the user is the owner of the asset, and a `LazyBidList` component that displays the bids for the asset. It also displays a `div` element that displays either the `HowReservations` component or the `SetSaleBid` component depending on whether the user is the owner of the asset, and another `LazyBidList` component that displays the asks for the asset. If the user is not connected to a Web3 provider, it displays the `Web3Connect` component. \n\nOverall, the `AssetModal` component provides a way for users to view information about a specific asset and place bids or asks for the asset. It uses several other components and hooks from the project to display the necessary information and functionality.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AssetModal` component?\n- The `AssetModal` component is used to display information about a specific asset, including its sale price, bids, and how to place a bid.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `DROP_ID` constant?\n- The `DROP_ID` constant is used to identify a specific drop or collection of assets within the application.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useActiveWeb3React` hook?\n- The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to access the active Web3 provider and account information, which is necessary for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and placing bids on assets.",
