  "summary": "This code defines a mapping of Chainlink price feed addresses for various blockchain networks. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for accessing the addresses of Chainlink price feeds on different networks. \n\nThe code imports mappings for different networks from separate files and defines a type for the ChainlinkPriceFeedMap object. This object contains key-value pairs where the key is the address of the Chainlink price feed and the value is an object containing information about the price feed, such as the from and to tokens, decimals, and warning messages. \n\nThe code also defines a constant CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP, which is an object that maps ChainId values to the corresponding ChainlinkPriceFeedMap for that network. ChainId is an enum defined in the @zoolabs/zdk library that represents the different blockchain networks. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to easily access the addresses of Chainlink price feeds on different networks. For example, if a function in the project needs to retrieve the address of a Chainlink price feed on the BSC network, it can simply access the BSC object in the CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP constant. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { ChainId } from '@zoolabs/zdk'\nimport { CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP } from './path/to/zoo'\n\nconst bscPriceFeeds = CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP[ChainId.BSC]\nconst ethUsdPriceFeed = bscPriceFeeds['0x8AC76a51cc950d9822D68b83fE1Ad97B32Cd580d']\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a mapping of Chainlink price feed addresses for various blockchain networks.\n\n2. What is the `ChainId` type from `@zoolabs/zdk` used for?\n- The `ChainId` type is used as a key in the `CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP` object to associate each Chainlink price feed mapping with a specific blockchain network.\n\n3. What information is included in each Chainlink price feed mapping?\n- Each mapping includes the `from` and `to` currency symbols, the number of decimals for each currency, and optional warning and address fields.",
