  "summary": "This code defines several constants related to gas prices and the Archer protocol for use in the larger zoo project. \n\nThe `import` statements at the top of the file bring in two external libraries: `@zoolabs/zdk` and `@ethersproject/bignumber`. The former provides access to the `ChainId` and `JSBI` types, while the latter provides access to the `BigNumber` type.\n\nThe first two constants defined in the file, `ARCHER_RELAY_URI` and `ARCHER_GAS_URI`, are objects that map `ChainId` values to URLs for the Archer protocol's transaction and gas APIs, respectively. These constants are used to configure the zoo project's interactions with the Archer protocol.\n\nThe next three constants, `DEFAULT_ARCHER_GAS_ESTIMATE`, `DEFAULT_ARCHER_GAS_PRICES`, and `DEFAULT_ARCHER_ETH_TIP`, are all related to gas prices and are used to calculate the appropriate gas fees for transactions. \n\n`DEFAULT_ARCHER_GAS_ESTIMATE` is a `BigNumber` that represents the default gas estimate used by the Archer protocol, set to 250,000 wei. \n\n`DEFAULT_ARCHER_GAS_PRICES` is an array of `BigNumber` values representing default gas prices to use if other sources are unavailable. The values in the array are in ascending order and represent gas prices in wei per unit of gas, ranging from 60 Gwei to 2,000 Gwei. \n\n`DEFAULT_ARCHER_ETH_TIP` is a `JSBI` value representing the default miner tip to include with transactions. It is calculated as the product of the default gas estimate and the median gas price from the `DEFAULT_ARCHER_GAS_PRICES` array. \n\nOverall, this code provides important configuration constants for the zoo project's interactions with the Archer protocol, particularly related to gas prices and fees. These constants can be used throughout the project to ensure that transactions are executed with appropriate fees and that the Archer protocol is accessed using the correct URLs.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `@zoolabs/zdk` and `@ethersproject/bignumber` imports?\n- The `@zoolabs/zdk` import is used to access the `ChainId` and `JSBI` objects, while the `@ethersproject/bignumber` import is used to access the `BigNumber` object.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `ARCHER_RELAY_URI` and `ARCHER_GAS_URI` objects?\n- These objects are used to store the API endpoints for the Archer Relay and Archer Gas services respectively, with different endpoints for different `ChainId`s.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `DEFAULT_ARCHER_GAS_ESTIMATE`, `DEFAULT_ARCHER_GAS_PRICES`, and `DEFAULT_ARCHER_ETH_TIP` constants?\n- These constants are used to set default values for the gas estimate, gas prices, and miner tip respectively, which are used in transactions sent through the Archer Relay service.",
