  "summary": "This code defines a mapping of Chainlink price feed addresses for various blockchain networks. The code imports mappings for specific networks from separate files and combines them into a single object. The resulting object is exported as `CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP` and is of type `{ [chainId in ChainId]?: ChainlinkPriceFeedMap }`. \n\nThe `ChainId` enum is imported from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library and is used as the keys for the `CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP` object. Each key corresponds to a specific blockchain network, and the value is a `ChainlinkPriceFeedMap` object. \n\nThe `ChainlinkPriceFeedMap` type is defined as an object with string keys and values that contain information about a specific Chainlink price feed. The properties of each value include `from`, `to`, `decimals`, `fromDecimals`, `toDecimals`, `warning`, and `address`. These properties provide information about the currency pair being tracked, the number of decimal places for each currency, and any warnings associated with the price feed. \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to provide a centralized location for accessing Chainlink price feed addresses for various blockchain networks. Developers can import the `CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP` object and use it to retrieve the appropriate price feed address for a given network. For example, to retrieve the Chainlink price feed address for the Binance Smart Chain, a developer could use the following code:\n\n```\nimport { CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP, ChainId } from '@zoolabs/zdk'\n\nconst bscPriceFeed = CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP[ChainId.BSC]\nconst bnbUsdAddress = bscPriceFeed['0x0567F2323251f0Aab15c8dFb1967E4e8A7D42aeE'].address\n``` \n\nIn this example, the `bscPriceFeed` variable is assigned the `ChainlinkPriceFeedMap` object for the Binance Smart Chain, and the `bnbUsdAddress` variable is assigned the address for the BNB/USD price feed.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a mapping of Chainlink price feed addresses for various blockchain networks.\n\n2. What is the `ChainId` type from `@zoolabs/zdk` used for?\n- The `ChainId` type is used as a key in the `CHAINLINK_PRICE_FEED_MAP` object to associate each Chainlink price feed mapping with a specific blockchain network.\n\n3. What information is included in each Chainlink price feed mapping?\n- Each mapping includes the `from` and `to` currency symbols, the number of decimals for each currency, and optional warning and address fields.",
