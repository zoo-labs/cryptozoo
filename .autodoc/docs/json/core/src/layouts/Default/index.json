  "summary": "The `Layout` component in the `zoo` project is responsible for rendering the main layout of the application. It imports several components from the `../../components` directory, including `Banner`, `Footer`, `Header`, `Main`, and `Popups`. The `useActiveWeb3React` hook and `updateGasPrice` function are also imported from `../../hooks` and `../../state/network/actions`, respectively.\n\nThe `Layout` component takes in three props: `children`, `banner`, and `bg`. `children` is a required prop that represents the content to be rendered within the `Main` component. `banner` is an optional prop that represents the content to be rendered within the `Header` component. `bg` is an optional prop that represents the background color of the `Main` component.\n\nThe `useEffect` hook is used to update the gas price of the network whenever the `library` object changes. The `library` object is obtained from the `useActiveWeb3React` hook, which provides access to the active Web3 provider and account.\n\nThe `Layout` component returns a `div` element that contains the `Header`, `Main`, `Popups`, and `Footer` components. The `Header` component is passed the `banner` prop, which is rendered if it is defined. The `Main` component is passed the `children` and `bg` props, which represent the content to be rendered within the `Main` component and the background color of the `Main` component, respectively. The `Popups` component is used to render any popups that may appear on the screen. The `Footer` component is used to render the footer of the application.\n\nOverall, the `Layout` component is a high-level component that is used to render the main layout of the application. It is used throughout the `zoo` project to provide a consistent layout across all pages. Here is an example of how the `Layout` component can be used:\n\n```\nimport Layout from \"./Layout\";\n\nconst HomePage = () => {\n  return (\n    <Layout banner={<Banner />} bg=\"bg-[#fff]\">\n      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo!</h1>\n      <p>Explore our collection of exotic animals.</p>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default HomePage;\n```",
