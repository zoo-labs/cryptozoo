  "summary": "The `HomeLayout` component is a React component that serves as a layout for the home page of the zoo project. It imports several components from the `../../components` directory, including `Banner`, `Footer`, `Header`, `Main`, and `Popups`. \n\nThe component takes two props: `children` and `banner`. The `children` prop is used to render the content of the home page, while the `banner` prop is used to pass in a banner component to be displayed at the top of the page. If no banner is passed in, the `banner` prop is set to `undefined`.\n\nThe `useEffect` hook is used to update the gas price of the network whenever the `library` object changes. The `library` object is obtained using the `useActiveWeb3React` hook, which is a custom hook that provides access to the active Web3 provider and account.\n\nThe `return` statement renders the layout of the home page. It consists of a `div` element with a class of `z-0 flex flex-col items-center w-full h-screen pb-16 lg:pb-0`. This `div` element contains the `Header`, `Main`, and `Popups` components. The `Header` component is passed the `isModal` prop set to `false`, indicating that it is not a modal. The `transparent` prop is not passed in, so the header will not be transparent. The `banner` prop is passed in, which will be used to display the banner component at the top of the page. The `Main` component is passed the `isModal` prop set to `true`, indicating that it is a modal. The `children` prop is passed in, which will render the content of the home page. The `Popups` component is rendered at the bottom of the page.\n\nThis component can be used as a template for the home page of the zoo project. Developers can pass in their own content and banner components to customize the page. The `useEffect` hook can also be modified to update other aspects of the network as needed.",
