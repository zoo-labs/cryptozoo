  "summary": "The `Layout` component is a high-level layout wrapper for the pages in the `zoo` project. It imports several components from the `../../components` directory, including `Container`, `Footer`, `Header`, `Image`, `Main`, `NavLink`, and `Popups`. It also imports `Link` and `useRouter` from `next/link` and `next/router`, respectively. \n\nThe `Layout` component takes in three optional props: `left`, `children`, and `right`. `left` and `right` are JSX elements that are rendered in the left and right columns of a 12-column grid layout, respectively. `children` is a special prop that represents the content of the page that is being wrapped by the `Layout` component. \n\nThe `Layout` component renders a `div` element with a class of `z-0 flex flex-col items-start w-full h-screen`. This sets up the layout to be a full-height column flexbox with a z-index of 0. The `Header` component is then rendered with a `banner` prop set to `false`. The `Main` component is also rendered with an `isModal` prop set to `false`. \n\nInside the `Main` component, a `Container` component is rendered with a `className` prop set to `px-4 py-4 md:py-8 lg:py-12` and a `maxWidth` prop set to `7xl`. Inside the `Container`, there is a `div` element with a class of `mb-2 grid grid-cols-12 gap-4`. This sets up a 12-column grid layout with a 2-unit margin bottom. \n\nInside the grid, there are three columns: a logo column, a navigation column, and a content column. The logo column is a 3-column wide column that contains a link to the `/borrow` page with an image of the Kashi logo. The navigation column is a 9-column wide column that contains links to the `/lend`, `/borrow`, and `/kashi/create` pages. The content column is either an 8-column wide column or a 6-column wide column, depending on whether the `right` prop is defined. \n\nIf the `left` prop is defined, it is rendered in a 3-column wide column on the left side of the grid. If the `right` prop is defined, it is rendered in a 4-column wide column on the right side of the grid. The `children` prop is rendered in the remaining columns of the grid. \n\nFinally, the `Popups` and `Footer` components are rendered at the bottom of the layout. \n\nOverall, the `Layout` component provides a consistent layout for the pages in the `zoo` project, with a header, navigation, content area, and optional left and right columns. It also imports several reusable components from the `../../components` directory, making it easy to maintain a consistent look and feel across the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport Layout from \"./Layout\";\n\nexport default function MyPage() {\n  return (\n    <Layout left={<MySidebar />} right={<MyAds />}>\n      <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>\n      <p>This is some content.</p>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Layout` component?\n- The `Layout` component is responsible for rendering the overall layout of the application, including the header, main content, and footer.\n\n2. What are the optional props that can be passed to the `Layout` component?\n- The `Layout` component accepts three optional props: `left`, `children`, and `right`. `left` and `right` are JSX elements that will be rendered in the left and right columns of the layout, respectively. `children` is a React child or an array of React children that will be rendered in the main content area.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useRouter` hook from the `next/router` module?\n- The `useRouter` hook is used to access the Next.js router object, which provides information about the current route and allows for programmatic navigation. In this code, it is used to determine the current route and apply appropriate styling to the navigation links.",
