  "summary": "This code defines a number of types that are used to define various aspects of the visual design of a web application. These types include Breakpoints, MediaQueries, Spacing, Radii, Shadows, Gradients, Modal, Colors, and ZIndices. \n\nBreakpoints is an array of strings that define the different screen sizes at which the application should adjust its layout. MediaQueries is an object that defines the specific CSS media queries that correspond to each breakpoint. Spacing is an array of numbers that define the different spacing values that can be used throughout the application. Radii is an object that defines the different border radii that can be used for various elements. Shadows is an object that defines the different box shadows that can be used for various elements. Gradients is an object that defines the different gradient colors that can be used for various elements. Modal is an object that defines the colors and styles for modal windows. Colors is an object that defines the color palette for the application, including primary, secondary, and tertiary colors, as well as various shades of gray and other accent colors. Finally, ZIndices is an object that defines the z-index values for various elements, such as dropdown menus and modal windows.\n\nThese types can be used throughout the application to ensure consistency in the visual design. For example, the Spacing array can be used to ensure that all elements are spaced consistently throughout the application, regardless of their location. The Colors object can be used to ensure that all elements use the same color palette, making the application look cohesive and professional. The MediaQueries object can be used to ensure that the application is responsive and adjusts its layout appropriately for different screen sizes.\n\nHere is an example of how these types might be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport styled from 'styled-components';\nimport { Colors, Spacing } from 'zoo';\n\nconst Button = styled.button`\n  background-color: ${Colors.primary};\n  color: ${Colors.text};\n  padding: ${Spacing[2]}px ${Spacing[3]}px;\n  border-radius: ${Radii.default};\n  box-shadow: ${Shadows.level1};\n`;\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <Button>Click me!</Button>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the Button component uses the primary color from the Colors object, the default border radius from the Radii object, and the level 1 box shadow from the Shadows object. It also uses the second and third values from the Spacing array to set the padding. This ensures that the button looks consistent with other elements throughout the application.",
  "questions": "1. What are the different types defined in this code?\n- This code defines several types including Breakpoints, MediaQueries, Spacing, Radii, Shadows, Gradients, Modal, Colors, and ZIndices.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the Gradients type?\n- The Gradients type defines several gradient color values that can be used in the project, including bubblegum, buttongum, bubbleYum, starterAppGlare, and starterAppMarble.\n\n3. What is the ZIndices type used for?\n- The ZIndices type defines the z-index values for dropdown and modal components in the project.",
