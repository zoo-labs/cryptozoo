  "summary": "This code defines a light theme for the zoo project using the styled-components library. The DefaultTheme interface from styled-components is imported and used to define the type of the lightTheme object. The lightTheme object is created by spreading the properties of the base object defined in another file and adding additional properties specific to the light theme.\n\nThe lightTheme object has the following properties:\n- isDark: a boolean value set to false to indicate that this is a light theme\n- colors: an object containing color values specific to the light theme, imported from another file\n- alert, card, toggle, nav, modal, radio, and tooltip: commented out properties that could be added to the lightTheme object to customize the styling of specific components in the zoo project.\n\nThis code can be used to provide a consistent look and feel to the zoo project by defining a theme that can be easily applied to all components. For example, a component can be styled using the light theme by wrapping it in a ThemeProvider component from styled-components and passing the lightTheme object as a prop:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport { ThemeProvider } from 'styled-components'\nimport lightTheme from './path/to/lightTheme'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <ThemeProvider theme={lightTheme}>\n      {/* component code */}\n    </ThemeProvider>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis will apply the light theme to all styled components within the MyComponent component. By defining multiple themes, the zoo project can provide users with the ability to switch between different visual styles while maintaining a consistent design system.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `DefaultTheme` import from `styled-components`?\n- The `DefaultTheme` import is used to define the type of the `lightTheme` object as a default theme for styled components.\n\n2. Why are there multiple commented out imports for different components' themes?\n- The commented out imports suggest that the `lightTheme` object was originally intended to include theme settings for those components, but they were either not needed or not yet implemented.\n\n3. What is the `base` import and how is it used in the `lightTheme` object?\n- The `base` import is likely a separate file that contains shared theme settings. It is spread into the `lightTheme` object using the spread syntax (`...`) to merge the shared settings with the specific settings for the light theme.",
