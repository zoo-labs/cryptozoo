  "summary": "This code defines color schemes for the zoo project. The `Colors` type is imported from the `types` module, which is not shown in this code snippet. The `baseColors` object defines a set of colors that are used as the foundation for the light and dark color schemes. The `brandColors` object defines additional colors that are specific to the zoo brand. \n\nThe `lightColors` object extends the `baseColors` and `brandColors` objects to define a color scheme for light mode. The `darkColors` object extends the same base objects to define a color scheme for dark mode. \n\nEach color scheme defines a set of colors for various elements of the user interface, such as the background, text, and borders. The color values are specified as hexadecimal codes or RGB values. The `gradients` property defines a set of gradient styles that can be used for backgrounds or other elements. \n\nThis code is used to ensure consistency in the color scheme across the entire zoo project. Other modules can import the `lightColors` or `darkColors` objects to use the defined color scheme. For example, a component that needs to display a button can import the `lightColors` object and use the `primary` color for the button background. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { lightColors } from 'zoo/colors';\n\nconst buttonStyle = {\n  backgroundColor: lightColors.primary,\n  color: lightColors.text,\n  border: `1px solid ${lightColors.borderColor}`,\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Colors` import from `./types`?\n- The `Colors` import from `./types` is used to define the type of the `lightColors` and `darkColors` objects.\n\n2. What is the difference between `baseColors` and `brandColors`?\n- `baseColors` contains a set of colors that are used throughout the application, while `brandColors` contains colors specific to the brand of the application.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `gradients` object in `lightColors` and `darkColors`?\n- The `gradients` object in `lightColors` and `darkColors` contains a set of linear gradients that can be used as background colors for various elements in the application.",
