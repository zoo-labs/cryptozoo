  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a button for placing a bid on a sale item in a marketplace. The component takes in several props, including the details of the sale item (ask), the ID of the item being sold (dropId), the name of the item (name), the amount of the bid (amount), and the currency token used for the bid (currencyToken). The component also has an optional prop for whether the user is allowed to place a bid (isAllowed).\n\nWhen the user clicks the button, the setLazyBid function is called. This function creates a Bid object with the details of the bid, including the bidder's account, the bid amount, and whether the bid is offline. If the currency token is the native currency (e.g. ETH), the function calls the setLazyBid function on the App contract with the bid details and the user's account information. If the currency token is an ERC-20 token, the function calls the setLazyBidERC20 function on the App contract instead. Both functions take in the dropId and name of the item being sold, as well as the gas price for the transaction.\n\nIf the bid is successful, the function adds a transaction popup to the user's screen with a summary of the transaction. If there is an error, the function adds an error popup instead.\n\nThe component also has a Switch component that allows the user to toggle whether the bid is offline. If the user is an offline bidder, the component shows the Switch and sets the offline state to true when the user toggles it. The component checks whether the user is an offline bidder by calling the isOfflineBidder function on the Market contract with the user's account information.\n\nOverall, this component is a key part of the bidding process in the marketplace and allows users to place bids on sale items with ease.",
