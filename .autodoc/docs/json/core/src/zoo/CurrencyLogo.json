  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `CurrencyLogo` that renders an image of a currency symbol. The component takes in three props: `symbol`, `size`, and `className`. The `symbol` prop is required and can be either a `CurrencySymbol` enum value or a string. The `size` prop is optional and defaults to 32. The `className` prop is also optional and can be used to add additional CSS classes to the rendered image.\n\nThe component uses the `CURRENCY_SYMBOL_LOGO` object from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library to determine the URL of the image to be displayed. The `CURRENCY_SYMBOL_LOGO` object maps each currency symbol to its corresponding image URL. If the `symbol` prop matches a key in the `CURRENCY_SYMBOL_LOGO` object, the component will render an `Image` component from the `next/image` library with the appropriate `src`, `alt`, `className`, `width`, and `height` props.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that requires displaying currency symbols. For example, a financial application that displays account balances in different currencies could use this component to display the currency symbol next to each balance. Here's an example of how the `CurrencyLogo` component could be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport CurrencyLogo from \"./CurrencyLogo\";\n\nconst AccountBalance = ({ currency, balance }) => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CurrencyLogo symbol={currency} size={24} />\n      <span>{balance}</span>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, the `AccountBalance` component takes in two props: `currency` and `balance`. The `currency` prop is a string representing the currency symbol, and the `balance` prop is a number representing the account balance. The component renders a `CurrencyLogo` component with the `symbol` prop set to the `currency` prop and the `size` prop set to 24. The component also renders a `span` element with the `balance` prop as its text content.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a component called `CurrencyLogo` that displays an image logo for a given currency symbol.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code have?\n   This code imports two dependencies: `next/image` and `@zoolabs/zdk`.\n\n3. What props can be passed to the `CurrencyLogo` component?\n   The `CurrencyLogo` component accepts three props: `symbol` (a currency symbol or string), `size` (an optional number for the size of the logo), and `className` (an optional string for additional CSS classes).",
