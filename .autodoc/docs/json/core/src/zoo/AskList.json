  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `AskList` that queries a GraphQL API for a list of \"asks\" and renders them as a list of `AskItem` components. An \"ask\" is a request to sell a digital asset (e.g. an NFT) for a certain amount of currency. \n\nThe `AskList` component takes several props: `where` is an object that can contain filters for the query (e.g. to only show asks for a certain media or owner), `empty` is an optional JSX element to render if there are no asks, and `showToken` is a boolean flag to determine whether to show the token symbol for the currency in addition to the amount.\n\nThe component uses the `useQuery` hook from the `@apollo/client` library to fetch data from the GraphQL API. The query is defined using the `gql` template literal tag and fetches the `id`, `amount`, `createdAtTimestamp`, `currency`, `owner`, and `media` fields for each ask. The `where` object is passed as a variable to the query, with optional filters for `media` and `owner` fields.\n\nThe `usePrice` hook from a `state` module is used to get a function `getUsdAmount` that converts an amount of currency to its equivalent in USD. The `router` hook from the `next/router` module is used to navigate to a new page when an `AskItem` is clicked.\n\nThe `loading`, `error`, and `data` variables returned by `useQuery` are destructured and used to conditionally render the list of `AskItem` components. If there are no asks, the `empty` prop is rendered (or a default message if `empty` is not provided). If there are asks, each one is mapped to an `AskItem` component with the `getUsdAmount` and `onClick` props passed in.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display a list of asks for a particular digital asset marketplace. It can be customized with filters and styling to fit the specific needs of the project. Here is an example usage of the `AskList` component:\n\n```jsx\n<AskList where={{ media: 'my-media-id' }} showToken empty={<div>No asks for this media.</div>} />\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AskList` component?\n- The `AskList` component is used to display a list of asks (offers to sell) for media items, with optional filtering and display options.\n\n2. What GraphQL query is being used to fetch data for the `AskList` component?\n- The `GET_ASKS` query is being used to fetch data for the `AskList` component, which retrieves the ID, amount, timestamp, currency, owner, and media information for a list of asks.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `onClick` function in the `AskList` component?\n- The `onClick` function is used to handle click events on an ask item, and it navigates to a URL with a query parameter for the media ID of the ask item.",
