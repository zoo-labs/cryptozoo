  "summary": "The `LazyBidItem` component is a React component that renders a single item in a list of bids. It takes in a `bid` object, which contains information about the bid, such as the bidder, the amount, and the currency. It also takes in several optional props, such as `showToken`, `summary`, and `onClick`, which determine how the bid is displayed and what actions can be taken on it.\n\nThe component first imports several dependencies, including icons from the Heroicons library, currency and token classes from the ZDK library, and various utility functions from other files in the project. It then defines the `LazyBidItem` component as a function that takes in a `bid` object and several optional props. Inside the component, it uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the current chain ID and account, and sets up some state variables using the `useState` hook.\n\nThe component then defines an effect that runs whenever the chain ID changes, and uses the `getCurrencyTokenLowerCase` function to get the currency token associated with the bid. If a token is found, it sets the `currencyToken` state variable to the token and formats the bid amount using the `formatCurrencyAmountWithCommas` function.\n\nThe component then renders the bid information using a combination of conditional rendering and CSS classes. If `showToken` is true, it displays the name of the media being bid on, the bidder's address, and the time the bid was created. If `showToken` is false, it displays the bidder's address and a summary of the bid. It also displays the bid amount and currency symbol, and optionally displays the USD value of the bid if the `getUsdAmount` function is available. Finally, if an `onClick` function is provided, it renders an eye icon that can be clicked to view more details about the bid.\n\nOverall, this component is a small but important part of a larger project that likely involves buying and selling digital assets using various cryptocurrencies. It provides a flexible and reusable way to display individual bids in a list, and can be customized to fit different use cases by passing in different props.",
