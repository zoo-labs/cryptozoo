  "summary": "The `BidItem` component is a React component that renders a single bid item. It takes in a `bid` object, which contains information about the bid, such as the bidder, the amount, and the currency used. It also takes in some optional props, such as `showToken`, `summary`, and `onClick`, which determine how the bid item is displayed and what actions can be taken on it.\n\nThe component first imports several dependencies, such as icons, currency and token types, and various utility functions. It then defines the `BidProps` type, which specifies the shape of the `bid` object and the optional props. It also defines the `BidItem` component, which takes in the `bid` object and the optional props as props.\n\nInside the component, it first uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the current chain ID and account. It then initializes some state variables using the `useState` hook, such as `formattedAmount` and `currencyToken`. It also uses the `useEffect` hook to update the `currencyToken` state variable when the chain ID changes.\n\nThe component then renders the bid item using JSX. It conditionally renders different elements based on the `showToken` prop. If `showToken` is true, it displays information about the bid, such as the name of the asset being bid on, the ID of the asset, the bidder's address, and the time the bid was made. If `showToken` is false, it displays information about the bidder, such as the bidder's address and a summary of the bid.\n\nThe component also displays the bid amount and the currency used, as well as an eye icon that can be clicked to view more details about the bid. It formats the bid amount using the `formatCurrencyAmountWithCommas` function and the `currencyToken` state variable. It also calculates the USD value of the bid using the `getUsdAmount` function from the `usePrice` hook.\n\nOverall, the `BidItem` component is a reusable component that can be used to display bid items in various parts of the larger project. It provides a flexible and customizable way to display bid information and allows users to view more details about each bid.",
