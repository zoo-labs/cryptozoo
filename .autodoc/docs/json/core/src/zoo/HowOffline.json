  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `HowOffline` that renders a section of text explaining how offline asks work in the context of a smart contract-based marketplace for NFTs. The component takes a single prop called `onClick`, which is a function to be called when the user clicks the \"Ok\" button at the end of the text.\n\nThe text itself explains that an offline ask is a way for a buyer to place a bid on an NFT without sending funds to the smart contract. Instead, the buyer and seller will need to arrange a separate transaction outside of the platform, such as a bank wire transfer. Once the seller has verified receipt of the funds, they can accept the bid, which will transfer ownership of the NFT to the buyer.\n\nThis component is likely to be used as part of a larger user interface for the marketplace, perhaps as a modal or tooltip that appears when the user selects the option to place an offline ask. The `onClick` prop could be used to dismiss the modal or perform some other action in response to the user acknowledging the information presented.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport HowOffline from './HowOffline';\n\nfunction PlaceOfflineAsk() {\n  const handleOkClick = () => {\n    // Do something when the user clicks \"Ok\"\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Place an Offline Ask</h1>\n      <p>...</p>\n      <HowOffline onClick={handleOkClick} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code is a React component that explains how offline asks work in the context of buying and selling NFTs.\n\n2. What is the expected behavior when the \"Ok\" button is clicked?\n   \n   When the \"Ok\" button is clicked, it will trigger the onClick function that is passed as a prop to the component.\n\n3. How can a buyer send funds for an offline ask?\n   \n   A buyer can send funds for an offline ask through an \"over the counter\" deal, such as a bank wire transfer, directly to the seller.",
