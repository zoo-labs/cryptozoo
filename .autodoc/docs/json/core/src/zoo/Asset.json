  "summary": "The `Asset` component is a React component that renders an asset, which can be an image or a video, along with some metadata such as the asset's name, ID, and price. The component takes in several props, including the `tokenId` and `contentURI` of the asset, as well as optional props such as `ask`, `highest`, `formattedAmount`, `usdAmount`, and `symbol`. \n\nThe component first imports several dependencies, including `React`, `react-player`, `@zoolabs/zdk`, and `next/image`. It also imports several custom functions and types from other files in the project. \n\nInside the component, it uses several hooks such as `useActiveWeb3React` and `useContract` to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and retrieve data from the project's smart contracts. It also uses the `getContent` function to parse the `contentURI` and extract the asset's type, image, video, and name. \n\nThe component conditionally renders either an image or a video based on the `large` prop and whether the asset has a video. It also renders the asset's metadata, including its name, ID, and price. If the asset has a highest bid, it displays the bidder's address and the bid amount. If the user is the owner of the asset, it also displays a button to accept the highest bid. \n\nOverall, the `Asset` component is a reusable component that can be used to display assets throughout the project. It handles the rendering of the asset and its metadata, as well as interactions with the blockchain such as retrieving the highest bid and accepting bids.",

What is the role of the `useActiveWeb3React` and `useContract` hooks?\n- The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to retrieve the current user's Ethereum account information, while the `useContract` hook is used to retrieve a specific smart contract instance based on its name.",
