  "summary": "The code defines an interface called `Product` which represents the properties of a product in the zoo project. The `Product` interface has several properties including `name`, `basePrice`, `discountPrice`, `description`, `shortDescription`, `properties`, `image`, `galleryImages`, `quantity`, `id`, `status`, and `createdAt`. \n\nThe `name` property is a string that represents the name of the product. The `basePrice` property is a string that represents the original price of the product before any discounts are applied. The `discountPrice` property is a string that represents the price of the product after any discounts are applied. The `description` property is a string that represents a detailed description of the product. The `shortDescription` property is a string that represents a brief description of the product. \n\nThe `properties` property is an object that contains three arrays: `colors`, `sizes`, and `adendums`. The `colors` array contains strings that represent the available colors of the product. The `sizes` array contains strings that represent the available sizes of the product. The `adendums` array contains strings that represent any additional features or details of the product. \n\nThe `image` property is a string that represents the URL of the main image of the product. The `galleryImages` property is an array of strings that represents the URLs of additional images of the product. The `quantity` property is a number that represents the available quantity of the product. The `id` property is a string that represents the unique identifier of the product. The `status` property is a string that represents the current status of the product (e.g. \"available\", \"out of stock\", etc.). The `createdAt` property is a string that represents the date and time when the product was created.\n\nThis interface is likely used throughout the zoo project to represent products in various contexts such as in the database, in the user interface, and in API responses. For example, when retrieving a list of products from the database, the resulting objects would likely conform to the `Product` interface. \n\nHere is an example of how the `Product` interface could be used in TypeScript code:\n\n```\nimport { Product } from './zoo';\n\nconst product: Product = {\n  name: 'Giraffe Plushie',\n  basePrice: '19.99',\n  discountPrice: '14.99',\n  description: 'A soft and cuddly plushie of a giraffe.',\n  shortDescription: 'Soft and cuddly giraffe plushie.',\n  properties: {\n    colors: ['yellow', 'brown'],\n    sizes: ['small', 'medium', 'large'],\n    adendums: ['removable bowtie']\n  },\n  image: 'https://example.com/giraffe-plushie.jpg',\n  galleryImages: [\n    'https://example.com/giraffe-plushie-1.jpg',\n    'https://example.com/giraffe-plushie-2.jpg'\n  ],\n  quantity: 10,\n  id: '12345',\n  status: 'available',\n  createdAt: '2021-01-01T00:00:00.000Z'\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?** \nThis code defines an interface for a product in the zoo project, including its name, pricing, description, properties, images, quantity, and status.\n\n2. **What is the difference between `basePrice` and `discountPrice`?** \n`basePrice` likely refers to the original price of the product, while `discountPrice` refers to a discounted price that may be offered for the product.\n\n3. **What is the format of the `createdAt` property?** \nThe `createdAt` property is a string, but it is unclear what format it is in. It would be helpful to have documentation or comments explaining the expected format.",
