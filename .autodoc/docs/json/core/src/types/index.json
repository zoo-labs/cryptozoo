  "summary": "This file contains a set of interfaces that define the structure of various objects used in the larger project. These interfaces include `Drop`, `Animal`, `Egg`, `AvailableEgg`, `EggAttribute`, `AuctionHistory`, `Auction`, `Bid`, `Ask`, `ANIMAL_TYPE`, `CardEgg`, `EggCardType`, `ToastsState`, and `Proposal`. \n\nThe `Drop` interface defines the structure of a drop, which includes a title, description, items (either an array of `AvailableEgg` or `Animal` objects), supply, minted, dropSupply, dropId, and image. \n\nThe `Animal` interface defines the structure of an animal, which includes an optional owner, kind, tokenID, parentA, parentB, name, description, yield, boost, rarity, dob, startBid, currentBid, buyNow, imageUrl, listed, bloodline, selected, bred, breedCount, timeRemaining, CTAOverride, lastBred, revealed, freed, createdAt, and updatedAt. \n\nThe `Egg` interface defines the structure of an egg, which includes an owner, kind, tokenID, parentA, parentB, basic, timeRemaining, CTAOverride, burned, interactive, hatched, animalID, createdAt, updatedAt, and hatching. \n\nThe `AvailableEgg` interface defines the structure of an available egg, which includes bidShares, birthday, exist, id, kind, minted, name, price, supply, timestamp, image, animation_url, attributes, and description. \n\nThe `EggAttribute` interface defines the structure of an egg attribute, which includes a trait_type and value. \n\nThe `AuctionHistory` interface defines the structure of an auction history, which includes a value, from_address, blockNumber, block_timestamp, and transaction_hash. \n\nThe `Auction` interface defines the structure of an auction, which includes an array of `AuctionHistory` objects, a description, index, tokenID, auctionId, tokenOwner, reservePrice, firstBidTime, duration, curatorFeePercentage, amount, tokenUri, name, image, animation_url, attributes, kind, glb_animation_url, and usdz_animation_url. \n\nThe `Bid` interface defines the structure of a bid, which includes an amount, currency, bidder, recipient, and sellOnFee. \n\nThe `Ask` interface defines the structure of an ask, which includes an amount, currency, and sellOnFee. \n\nThe `ANIMAL_TYPE` type defines the structure of an animal type, which includes a name, image, and description (which includes a head and desc). \n\nThe `CardEgg` interface extends the `Egg` interface and adds an id and name property. \n\nThe `EggCardType` type defines the structure of an egg card, which includes an `egg` object (of type `CardEgg`), `hatchEgg` and `hatchEggReady` functions, a `hatching` boolean, a `viewItem` function, and an `eggGroup` object. \n\nThe `ToastsState` interface defines the structure of the toast state, which includes a `data` array of `Toast` objects. \n\nThe `Proposal` interface defines the structure of a proposal, which includes a signature, timestamp, token, type, tokenDecimal, tokenAddress, id, proposalType, proposalStatus, proposalIpfs, votes, voteCount, title, description, choices, startDate, startTime, endDate, endTime, creator, and blockNumber. \n\nOverall, this file provides a set of interfaces that define the structure of various objects used in the larger project. These interfaces can be used to ensure that objects are properly formatted and to provide type checking throughout the codebase. For example, if a function expects an `Animal` object as an argument, it can specify that in its type signature, and TypeScript will ensure that the object passed in conforms to the `Animal` interface.",
  "questions": "1. What are the interfaces `Animal` and `Egg` used for?\n   - The `Animal` interface is used to define the properties of an animal object, while the `Egg` interface is used to define the properties of an egg object.\n2. What is the purpose of the `Auction` interface?\n   - The `Auction` interface is used to define the properties of an auction object, which includes information such as the auction ID, reserve price, and duration.\n3. What is the `Toast` component used for?\n   - The `Toast` component is imported from the `components/Toast` module and is likely used to display notifications or alerts to the user.",
