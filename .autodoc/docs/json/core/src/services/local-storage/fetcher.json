  "summary": "The code provided is a simple local storage fetcher function that exports as a default. The purpose of this function is to retrieve data from the local storage of the browser based on a given key. The function takes in a single parameter, which is the key to be used to retrieve the data from the local storage. \n\nThe function first uses the `localStorage.getItem()` method to retrieve the value associated with the given key from the local storage. If the value is not found, the function returns `undefined`. However, if the value is found, the function uses the `JSON.parse()` method to parse the value from a string to a JavaScript object and returns the parsed object.\n\nThis function can be used in a larger project that requires data to be stored and retrieved from the local storage of the browser. For example, if a web application requires user preferences to be saved and retrieved across sessions, this function can be used to store and retrieve the preferences from the local storage. \n\nHere is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```\nimport fetcher from 'zoo/fetcher'\n\n// Store user preferences\nconst preferences = {\n  theme: 'dark',\n  language: 'en'\n}\nlocalStorage.setItem('preferences', JSON.stringify(preferences))\n\n// Retrieve user preferences using the fetcher function\nconst retrievedPreferences = await fetcher('preferences')\nconsole.log(retrievedPreferences) // { theme: 'dark', language: 'en' }\n``` \n\nIn this example, the `fetcher` function is used to retrieve the user preferences that were previously stored in the local storage. The preferences are stored as a JavaScript object, but they need to be converted to a string using `JSON.stringify()` before being stored in the local storage. The `fetcher` function is then used to retrieve the preferences by passing in the key `'preferences'`. The retrieved preferences are then logged to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   Answer: This code exports an asynchronous function called `fetcher` that retrieves a value from local storage and returns it as a parsed JSON object.\n\n2. What happens if the specified key does not exist in local storage?\n   Answer: If the specified key does not exist in local storage, the function returns `undefined`.\n\n3. Is this code part of a larger project or library?\n   Answer: Yes, the code is part of the `swr` library and is located in an example file in the `storage-tab-sync` directory.",
