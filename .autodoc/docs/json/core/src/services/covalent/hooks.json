  "summary": "This code provides a set of functions that can be used to fetch data from the Covalent API. The Covalent API provides a unified interface to access blockchain data across multiple chains. The functions in this code use the `useSWR` hook from the `swr` library to fetch data from the Covalent API and return it to the calling code.\n\nThe functions are organized into two classes: Class A and Class B. Class A contains functions that fetch data related to tokens, blocks, transactions, and NFTs. The functions in Class A take parameters such as `chainId`, `address`, `tokenId`, `blockHeight`, etc. to specify the data to be fetched. For example, the `useTokenBalances` function fetches the token balances for a given address on a given chain. The `useBlock` function fetches the block data for a given block height on a given chain. The `useNftMetadata` function fetches the metadata for a given NFT token on a given chain.\n\nClass B contains functions that fetch data related to chains and their status. The `useChains` function fetches the list of chains supported by the Covalent API, while the `useChainsStatus` function fetches the status of each chain.\n\nAll functions take an optional `fallbackData` parameter, which is used to provide initial data while the API call is being made. This can be useful for improving the user experience by showing some data immediately while the rest of the data is being fetched.\n\nThe functions in this code can be used in any React application that needs to fetch blockchain data from the Covalent API. For example, a DeFi dashboard application could use these functions to fetch data about the user's token balances, transaction history, and NFT holdings. The `useSWR` hook used in these functions provides a simple way to manage the state of the fetched data and update it automatically when needed.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code provides a set of functions that use SWR to fetch data from the Covalent API for various blockchain-related tasks such as getting token balances, transaction details, and NFT metadata.\n\n2. What is the role of the `useActiveWeb3React` hook?\n- The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to get the current chain ID from the active Web3React context, which is then used as a parameter for some of the API endpoints.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the commented out \"CLASS B\" section?\n- It is unclear from the provided code what the purpose of the commented out \"CLASS B\" section is, so a smart developer might wonder if it is unfinished code or if it was intentionally left out for some reason.",
