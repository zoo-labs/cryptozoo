  "summary": "This code defines GraphQL queries for retrieving information about blocks in a blockchain. The `blockFieldsQuery` defines a fragment that specifies the fields to be returned for a block, including its `id`, `number`, and `timestamp`. \n\nThe `blockQuery` is a GraphQL query that retrieves the most recent block that matches a given filter. It takes a filter object as an argument and returns the first block that matches the filter, sorted by timestamp in descending order. The query includes the `blockFields` fragment to specify the fields to be returned for the block. \n\nThe `blocksQuery` is a GraphQL query that retrieves a list of blocks that match a given time range. It takes four arguments: `first` (the number of blocks to return), `skip` (the number of blocks to skip), `start` (the start of the time range), and `end` (the end of the time range). The query returns the blocks sorted by block number in descending order and includes the `blockFields` fragment to specify the fields to be returned for each block. \n\nThe `massBlocksQuery` is a function that takes an array of timestamps and returns a GraphQL query that retrieves the first block after each timestamp. The query includes a separate block query for each timestamp, with the query name being the timestamp value. The query includes the `blockFields` fragment to specify the fields to be returned for each block. \n\nThese queries can be used to retrieve information about blocks in a blockchain, such as their number, timestamp, and other metadata. The `blockQuery` can be used to retrieve the most recent block that matches a given filter, while the `blocksQuery` can be used to retrieve a list of blocks that match a given time range. The `massBlocksQuery` can be used to retrieve the first block after a list of timestamps, which can be useful for tracking the progress of the blockchain over time. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { blockQuery, blocksQuery, massBlocksQuery } from 'zoo'\n\n// Retrieve the most recent block\nconst latestBlock = await client.query({\n  query: blockQuery,\n  variables: { where: { number_gt: 0 } }\n})\n\n// Retrieve the blocks in a given time range\nconst blocksInRange = await client.query({\n  query: blocksQuery,\n  variables: { first: 100, skip: 0, start: 1609459200, end: 1609545600 }\n})\n\n// Retrieve the first block after a list of timestamps\nconst timestamps = [1609459200, 1609462800, 1609466400]\nconst massBlocks = await client.query({\n  query: massBlocksQuery(timestamps)\n})\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `blockFieldsQuery` fragment?\n- The `blockFieldsQuery` fragment defines the fields that should be returned for a `Block` object.\n\n2. What is the difference between `blockQuery` and `blocksQuery`?\n- `blockQuery` returns the most recent `Block` object that matches the specified filter, while `blocksQuery` returns a list of `Block` objects that match the specified filter.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `massBlocksQuery` function?\n- The `massBlocksQuery` function generates a GraphQL query that returns the first `Block` object that matches a list of timestamps, sorted in ascending order by timestamp.",
