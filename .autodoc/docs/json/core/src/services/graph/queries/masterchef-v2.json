  "summary": "This code defines two GraphQL queries for the zoo project. The first query, `poolsV2Query`, retrieves information about pools in the project. The query takes in several variables, including `first`, `skip`, `orderBy`, `orderDirection`, `block`, and `where`. These variables are used to filter and sort the results of the query. The query returns information about each pool, including its ID, the pair associated with the pool, the allocation point for the pool, the SLP balance for the pool, and information about the pool's master chef and rewarder.\n\nThe second query, `masterChefV2PairAddressesQuery`, retrieves information about the pair addresses associated with the master chef in the project. This query takes in several variables, including `first`, `skip`, `orderBy`, `orderDirection`, and `where`. The query returns information about each pool associated with the master chef, including its ID, allocation point, accumulated Sushi per share, and the ID of the pair associated with the pool.\n\nThese queries can be used in the larger zoo project to retrieve information about pools and pair addresses associated with the master chef. For example, the `poolsV2Query` could be used to display a list of all pools in the project, sorted by allocation point or SLP balance. The `masterChefV2PairAddressesQuery` could be used to display a list of all pair addresses associated with the master chef, along with information about each pool. \n\nHere is an example of how the `poolsV2Query` could be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { useQuery } from '@apollo/client';\nimport { poolsV2Query } from './zoo';\n\nfunction PoolList() {\n  const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(poolsV2Query);\n\n  if (loading) return <p>Loading...</p>;\n  if (error) return <p>Error :(</p>;\n\n  return (\n    <ul>\n      {data.pools.map(pool => (\n        <li key={pool.id}>\n          <p>Pool ID: {pool.id}</p>\n          <p>Pair: {pool.pair}</p>\n          <p>Allocation Point: {pool.allocPoint}</p>\n          <p>SLP Balance: {pool.slpBalance}</p>\n        </li>\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis component uses the `useQuery` hook from the `@apollo/client` library to fetch data using the `poolsV2Query`. The component displays a list of all pools in the project, along with their ID, pair, allocation point, and SLP balance.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines two GraphQL queries for the `pools` and `masterChefV2PairAddresses` endpoints.\n2. What parameters can be passed to the `poolsV2Query` query?\n   - The `poolsV2Query` query accepts parameters for `first`, `skip`, `orderBy`, `orderDirection`, `block`, and `where`.\n3. What data is returned by the `masterChefV2PairAddressesQuery` query?\n   - The `masterChefV2PairAddressesQuery` query returns the `id`, `allocPoint`, `accSushiPerShare`, and `pair` fields for each pool in the `pools` endpoint.",
