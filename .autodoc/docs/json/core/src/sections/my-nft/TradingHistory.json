  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `TradingHistory` that renders a trading history section on a web page. The component imports two modules, `React` and `Image` from `next/image`. \n\nThe `TradingHistory` component returns a JSX element that contains a `div` with a class name of `tradingHistory`. Inside this `div`, there is an `h3` element with a class name of `mb-12` that displays the text \"Trading History\". \n\nBelow the `h3` element, there is another `div` element with a class name of `mb-28`. This `div` contains an unordered list (`ul`) with a class name of `flex` and four list items (`li`) with class names of `mr-28`. The list items display the text \"ACTION\", \"BLOCK\", \"TOKEN ID\", and \"HASH\" respectively. \n\nBelow the unordered list, there is another `div` element with a class name of `rounded-xl tracking-tight not-italic py-8 px-3.5 text-xs leading-[3rem] lg:leading-4 font-bold text-center bg-trading-history`. This `div` contains two unordered lists (`ul`) with class names of `flex`. Each unordered list contains four list items (`li`) with class names of `mr-24`. The list items display the trading history data such as \"BOUGHT EGG\", \"12054184\", \"6\", and \"0xd8e1c294da833a8db\". \n\nThe `TradingHistory` component is exported as a default export, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, if there is a web page that displays a user's profile, the `TradingHistory` component can be used to display the user's trading history. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport TradingHistory from \"./components/TradingHistory\";\n\nfunction UserProfile() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>User Profile</h1>\n      <TradingHistory />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
