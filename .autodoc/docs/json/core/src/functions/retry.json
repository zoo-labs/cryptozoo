  "summary": "The code above provides a function called `retry` that allows a user to retry a function that returns a promise until the promise successfully resolves up to n retries. The function takes in a function to retry, the number of times to retry, and the minimum and maximum wait time between retries in milliseconds. \n\nThe `retry` function returns an object with two properties: `promise` and `cancel`. The `promise` property is the promise that is returned from the function that is being retried. The `cancel` property is a function that can be called to cancel the retry process. \n\nThe `retry` function uses a while loop to retry the function until it successfully resolves or until the maximum number of retries has been reached. If the function throws an error that is not a `RetryableError`, the retry process is stopped and the error is thrown. If the function throws a `RetryableError`, the retry process continues until the maximum number of retries has been reached or the function successfully resolves. \n\nThe `wait` and `waitRandom` functions are helper functions that are used to wait for a specified amount of time before retrying the function. The `CancelledError` and `RetryableError` classes are custom error classes that are used to differentiate between errors that should stop the retry process and errors that should allow the retry process to continue. \n\nHere is an example of how the `retry` function can be used:\n\n```\nasync function fetchData() {\n  const response = await fetch('https://example.com/data')\n  if (!response.ok) {\n    throw new RetryableError('Failed to fetch data')\n  }\n  return response.json()\n}\n\nconst { promise, cancel } = retry(fetchData, { n: 3, minWait: 1000, maxWait: 5000 })\n\npromise.then((data) => {\n  console.log('Data:', data)\n}).catch((error) => {\n  if (error instanceof CancelledError) {\n    console.log('Retry cancelled')\n  } else {\n    console.log('Retry failed:', error.message)\n  }\n})\n\n// Cancel the retry process after 10 seconds\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  cancel()\n}, 10000)\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `fetchData` function is retried up to 3 times with a minimum wait time of 1 second and a maximum wait time of 5 seconds between retries. If the retry process is cancelled before completing, a `CancelledError` is thrown. If the retry process fails after the maximum number of retries has been reached, a `RetryableError` is thrown.",
  "questions": "1. What does the `wait` function do and why is it used in this code?\n- The `wait` function returns a promise that resolves after a specified number of milliseconds. It is used to introduce a delay between retries in the `retry` function.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `RetryableError` class and how is it used in the `retry` function?\n- The `RetryableError` class is thrown when the function should be retried. It is used in the `retry` function to determine whether an error is retryable or not, and to break out of the retry loop if the maximum number of retries has been reached.\n\n3. What is the return value of the `retry` function and what does it contain?\n- The `retry` function returns an object with two properties: `promise` and `cancel`. The `promise` property is a promise that resolves with the result of the function being retried, or rejects with an error if the maximum number of retries has been reached. The `cancel` property is a function that can be called to cancel the retry loop and reject the promise with a `CancelledError`.",
