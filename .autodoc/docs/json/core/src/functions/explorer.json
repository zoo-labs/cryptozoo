  "summary": "The code defines a set of explorers and chains for the zoo project. The explorers are functions that take in a link, data, and type, and return a URL string for a specific blockchain explorer. The chains are objects that map a chain ID to a link and an explorer builder function. The `getExplorerLink` function takes in a chain ID, data, and type, and returns a URL string for the corresponding explorer.\n\nThe `explorers` object defines four explorer functions for etherscan, blockscout, harmony, and okex. Each function takes in a link, data, and type, and returns a URL string for a specific blockchain explorer. The `switch` statement inside each function determines the type of data and returns the corresponding URL string.\n\nThe `chains` object maps each chain ID to a link and an explorer builder function. The link is a string that represents the base URL for the corresponding blockchain explorer. The explorer builder function is one of the four explorer functions defined in the `explorers` object. The `ChainId` enum is imported from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library and is used to define the keys for the `chains` object.\n\nThe `getExplorerLink` function takes in a chain ID, data, and type, and returns a URL string for the corresponding explorer. It first retrieves the chain object from the `chains` object using the chain ID. It then calls the explorer builder function with the link, data, and type to generate the URL string.\n\nThis code is used to provide a consistent way of generating blockchain explorer URLs for different chains in the zoo project. It can be used by other modules in the project that need to generate explorer URLs for different chains. For example, if a module needs to generate an explorer URL for a transaction on the Ethereum mainnet, it can call `getExplorerLink(ChainId.MAINNET, txHash, 'transaction')` to get the URL string for the transaction on Etherscan.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `explorers` object?\n- The `explorers` object contains functions that generate links to blockchain explorers based on the type of data provided (transaction, token, address, or block).\n\n2. What is the `chains` object used for?\n- The `chains` object maps chain IDs to explorer links and builder functions that generate links for each chain.\n\n3. What does the `getExplorerLink` function do?\n- The `getExplorerLink` function takes a chain ID, data, and type as arguments, and returns a link to a blockchain explorer generated by the corresponding builder function for that chain.",
