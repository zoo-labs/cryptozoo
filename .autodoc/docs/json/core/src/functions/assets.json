  "summary": "The code above defines several constants and functions related to NFTs (non-fungible tokens) in the context of the zoo project. The `import` statements at the top of the file bring in two external dependencies: `ChainId` from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, and the `_` (underscore) utility library.\n\nThe constants defined in this file are `TYPE_VALIDATOR`, `TYPE_ATM`, `TYPE_WALLET`, and `TYPE_CASH`, which are strings representing different types of NFTs that can be owned in the zoo project.\n\nThe `newNft` function takes three arguments: `tokenId` (a unique identifier for the NFT), `type` (one of the constants defined above), and `props` (an optional object containing additional properties to be added to the NFT object). This function returns an object representing a new NFT, with the `tokenId`, `type`, `image`, and `video` properties set based on the input arguments. The `image` and `video` properties are hardcoded to point to files in the `/nfts` directory with filenames based on the `type` argument.\n\nThe remaining functions (`getOwnedNfts`, `getValidatorNfts`, `getAtmNfts`, `getWalletNfts`, and `getCashNfts`) all return arrays of NFT objects. `getOwnedNfts` returns an array of three NFTs of different types, while the other functions each return an array of six NFTs of a specific type. These functions use the `newNft` function to create the NFT objects, with the `tokenId` values incremented by a fixed amount for each NFT in the array.\n\nOverall, this code provides a way to create and retrieve NFT objects with various properties and types, which can be used in other parts of the zoo project. For example, these functions could be used to populate a user's NFT collection or to display NFTs in a marketplace. Here is an example usage of the `getOwnedNfts` function:\n\n```\nconst ownedNfts = getOwnedNfts()\nconsole.log(ownedNfts)\n// Output:\n// [\n//   { tokenId: 1, type: 'Validator', image: '/nfts/validator.gif', video: '/nfts/validator.mov' },\n//   { tokenId: 2, type: 'ATM', image: '/nfts/atm.gif', video: '/nfts/atm.mov' },\n//   { tokenId: 3, type: 'Wallet', image: '/nfts/wallet.gif', video: '/nfts/wallet.mov' }\n// ]\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ChainId` import from `@zoolabs/zdk`?\n   - It is not clear from this code snippet what the `ChainId` import is used for or how it relates to the rest of the code. Further investigation or context is needed to understand its purpose.\n\n2. What is the expected format of the `props` parameter in the `newNft` function?\n   - The `newNft` function takes in a `props` parameter, but it is not clear what properties are expected or what format they should be in. Additional documentation or comments within the code may be helpful in clarifying this.\n\n3. How are the generated NFTs intended to be used within the `zoo` project?\n   - While the code generates various types of NFTs, it is not clear from this snippet how they are intended to be used within the larger `zoo` project. Further context or documentation is needed to understand their purpose and how they fit into the project as a whole.",
