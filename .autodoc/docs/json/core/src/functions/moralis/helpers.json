  "summary": "This code defines two functions, `queryEggs` and `queryAnimals`, which are used to query data from a database using the Moralis library. The purpose of these functions is to retrieve information about eggs and animals in a zoo, respectively. \n\nThe code begins by importing the `Moralis` library, which is used to interact with a backend database. It then declares three types: `DefaultQueryAttribute`, `Query`, and `QueryPromise`. These types are used to define the structure of the data that will be returned by the queries.\n\nThe `queryEggs` function creates a new query object using the `Moralis.Query` method, which takes an argument specifying the name of the class of objects to be queried. In this case, the class is `Eggs`. The `limit` method is then called on the query object to specify the maximum number of results to be returned, and the `find` method is called to execute the query and return the results. However, in the current implementation, the function simply returns an empty array, indicating that no data is being retrieved.\n\nThe `queryAnimals` function follows a similar structure, but queries a different class of objects (`Animals`) and sets a different limit on the number of results to be returned. Again, the function simply returns an empty array.\n\nThese functions can be used in the larger project to retrieve data about eggs and animals in the zoo, which can then be used for various purposes such as displaying information to users or performing calculations. For example, the `queryAnimals` function could be used to retrieve a list of all the animals in the zoo, which could then be displayed on a webpage. \n\nHowever, in their current state, these functions are not very useful since they always return an empty array. The code needs to be modified to actually execute the queries and return the appropriate data.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Moralis` library and how is it being used in this code?\n   - The `Moralis` library is being imported and used to declare types and create queries for objects in the database.\n2. Why are the `queryEggs` and `queryAnimals` functions returning empty arrays?\n   - It is unclear from the code why these functions are returning empty arrays. It is possible that they are placeholders for future functionality or that they are being used for testing purposes.\n3. What is the significance of the `limit` parameter in the commented out code within the `queryEggs` and `queryAnimals` functions?\n   - The `limit` parameter is being used to limit the number of results returned by the query. In the case of `queryEggs`, it is limiting the results to 6000 and in the case of `queryAnimals`, it is limiting the results to 1000.",
