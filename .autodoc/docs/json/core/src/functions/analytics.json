  "summary": "This code is a set of functions that utilize the ReactGA library to log user activity on a website. The ReactGA library is a third-party analytics tool that allows developers to track user behavior and gain insights into how users interact with their website. \n\nThe `logPageView` function logs a page view by setting the page property to the current window location and then calling the `pageview` method. This function can be used to track which pages on the website are being viewed and how often they are being viewed. \n\nThe `logEvent` function logs a custom event with a specified category and action. This function can be used to track specific user interactions on the website, such as button clicks or form submissions. \n\nThe `logException` function logs an exception with a specified description and fatal flag. This function can be used to track errors or unexpected behavior on the website. \n\nOverall, these functions provide a way for developers to gain insights into how users are interacting with their website and identify areas for improvement. By using the ReactGA library, developers can easily integrate analytics tracking into their website without having to build their own tracking system from scratch. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { logPageView, logEvent, logException } from 'zoo'\n\n// Log a page view\nlogPageView()\n\n// Log a custom event\nlogEvent('Button Click', 'Submit Form')\n\n// Log an exception\nlogException('Error: Invalid input', true)\n```",
