  "summary": "This file contains a collection of utility functions for formatting various types of data. The functions are exported as individual named functions and can be used independently of each other. \n\nThe `capitalize` function takes a string as input and returns the same string with the first letter capitalized. \n\nThe `formatK` function takes a string as input and formats it in a human-readable way by abbreviating large numbers with a \"K\" suffix. For example, `formatK('1234567')` would return `'1.23M'`. \n\nThe `shortenAddress` function takes an Ethereum address as input and returns a shortened version of the address with only the first and last four characters visible. \n\nThe `shortenString` function takes a string and a length as input and returns a shortened version of the string with three dots in the middle. \n\nThe `formatPercent` function takes a string representation of a percentage as input and returns a formatted string with a percent sign. \n\nThe `formatNumber` function takes a number as input and returns a formatted string with commas and/or abbreviated with a \"K\" suffix. It also has options for formatting as USD and specifying the number of decimal places. \n\nThe `formatNumberScale` function is similar to `formatNumber` but uses a different scaling system based on the length of the number. \n\nThe `escapeRegExp` function takes a string as input and returns the same string with any special characters escaped so that it can be used as a regular expression. \n\nThe `formatBalance` function takes a BigNumberish value and returns a formatted string representing the value in ether. It also has options for specifying the number of decimal places and the maximum number of digits after the decimal point. \n\nThe `formatCurrencyAmount` and `formatPrice` functions take CurrencyAmount and Price objects, respectively, and return formatted strings representing the values. They also have options for specifying the number of significant figures. \n\nThe `formatDateAgo` function takes a Date object as input and returns a formatted string representing the time elapsed since that date. \n\nThe `formatCurrencyFromRawAmount` and `formatCurrencyAmountWithCommas` functions take a Currency object and a raw amount as input and return formatted strings representing the value in the specified currency. \n\nThe `numberWithCommas` function takes a number or string as input and returns a formatted string with commas separating the thousands. \n\nThe `formatError` function takes an error object as input and returns a formatted string representing the error message. \n\nOverall, these functions provide a variety of useful formatting options for different types of data that may be used throughout the larger project.",
