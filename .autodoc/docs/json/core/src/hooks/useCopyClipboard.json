  "summary": "The code above is a custom React hook that provides functionality for copying text to the clipboard. It uses the `copy-to-clipboard` library to perform the actual copying of the text. \n\nThe hook returns an array with two values: a boolean indicating whether the text has been copied to the clipboard, and a function that can be called to initiate the copying process. The function takes a single argument, `toCopy`, which is the text to be copied.\n\nThe `useCallback` hook is used to memoize the `staticCopy` function, which is responsible for performing the copying. This is done to prevent unnecessary re-renders of the component that uses this hook. \n\nThe `useEffect` hook is used to handle the state of the `isCopied` variable. When the text is successfully copied to the clipboard, `isCopied` is set to `true`. The `useEffect` hook then sets a timeout to reset `isCopied` to `false` after a specified amount of time (`timeout`). This timeout is cleared if the component unmounts before the timeout is reached.\n\nThis hook can be used in any React component that needs to provide a copy-to-clipboard functionality. For example, it could be used in a button component that copies a URL to the clipboard when clicked. \n\nHere is an example of how this hook could be used in a component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport useCopyClipboard from './useCopyClipboard'\n\nfunction CopyButton({ text }) {\n  const [isCopied, copyToClipboard] = useCopyClipboard()\n\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    copyToClipboard(text)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>\n      {isCopied ? 'Copied!' : 'Copy to Clipboard'}\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default CopyButton\n```\n\nIn this example, the `CopyButton` component takes a `text` prop, which is the text to be copied to the clipboard. When the button is clicked, the `copyToClipboard` function is called with the `text` prop as an argument. The `isCopied` value is used to display a message to the user indicating whether the text has been successfully copied.",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n   This code exports a custom React hook called `useCopyClipboard` that takes an optional timeout parameter and returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating whether the copy operation was successful and a function to copy text to the clipboard.\n\n2. What library dependencies does this code have?\n   This code imports two libraries: `copy-to-clipboard` and `react`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?\n   The `useEffect` hook is used to set a timeout to reset the `isCopied` state to `false` after a successful copy operation. It also clears the timeout if the `isCopied` state changes before the timeout is reached.",
