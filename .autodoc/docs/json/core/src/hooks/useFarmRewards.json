  "summary": "The `useFarmRewards` function is a custom React hook that retrieves and processes data related to farms and their rewards on the SushiSwap decentralized exchange. The hook imports various functions and constants from other files in the project, including enums, graph services, and other custom hooks.\n\nThe function first retrieves the current chain ID using the `useActiveWeb3React` hook. It then uses this ID to fetch the user's positions in the farms using the `usePositions` hook. The function also retrieves the block number from one week ago using the `useBlock` hook.\n\nNext, the function fetches data on all farms using the `useFarms` hook, and extracts the addresses of the pairs involved in these farms. It then uses the `useSushiPairs` and `useKashiPairs` hooks to fetch data on the SushiSwap and Kashi pairs, respectively, that correspond to these addresses. The function also retrieves data on the average block time, the total allocation points for the MasterChef V1 contract, and the SUSHI rewards per block for this contract.\n\nThe function then retrieves the current prices of various tokens, including SUSHI, ETH, MATIC, STAKE, and ONE, using various `useXPrice` hooks. It calculates the number of blocks per day based on the average block time, and defines a `map` function that processes data for each farm.\n\nThe `map` function first checks whether the farm is based on a SushiSwap or Kashi pair, and retrieves the corresponding pair data. It then calculates the rewards for the farm based on the allocation points, SUSHI rewards per block, and other factors. The function also calculates the total value locked (TVL) for the farm, as well as the fee APY per hour, day, month, and year. It then calculates the ROI per block, as well as the reward APY per hour, day, month, and year. Finally, the function returns an object containing all of this data, as well as the original farm data and the user's position in the farm.\n\nThe `useFarmRewards` function returns an array of objects, where each object corresponds to a farm and contains all of the processed data described above. This data can be used to display information about the farms and their rewards to the user, as well as to make decisions about which farms to invest in. For example, the ROI and reward APY data can be used to compare the profitability of different farms, while the TVL data can be used to assess the liquidity of each farm.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a custom React hook called `useFarmRewards` that fetches data from various subgraphs and services to calculate rewards and other metrics for farms in the Zoo project.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `@zoolabs/zdk`, `@ethersproject/address`, `react`, and various packages from the `../features`, `../services`, and `../functions` directories.\n\n3. What data is being fetched and processed by this code?\n- This code fetches data about farms, pairs, and rewards from various subgraphs and services, and processes this data to calculate metrics such as TVL, APR, and ROI for each farm. It also uses data from the `usePositions` hook to display information about the user's positions in each farm.",
