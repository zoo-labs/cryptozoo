  "summary": "The code defines a custom React hook called `useSearchAndSort` that can be used to search and sort an array of items. The hook takes in three arguments: `items`, `searchOptions`, and `sortOptions`. \n\nThe `items` argument is the array of items that needs to be searched and sorted. The `searchOptions` argument is an optional object that can be used to configure the search functionality. The `sortOptions` argument is an optional object that can be used to configure the sort functionality.\n\nThe hook returns an object that contains the following properties: `items`, `term`, `setTerm`, `sortConfig`, `setSortConfig`, and `requestSort`. \n\nThe `items` property is the sorted and searched array of items. The `term` property is the current search term. The `setTerm` property is a function that can be used to update the search term. The `sortConfig` property is an object that contains the current sort configuration. The `setSortConfig` property is a function that can be used to update the sort configuration. The `requestSort` property is a function that can be used to request a sort based on a specific key and direction.\n\nThe `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the sorted array of items. The `Fuse` library is used to perform the search functionality. The `getNested` function is a helper function that is used to get the value of a nested property in an object.\n\nThe `useSearchAndSort` hook can be used in a React component to search and sort an array of items. Here is an example of how the hook can be used:\n\n```\nimport useSearchAndSort from './useSearchAndSort'\n\nconst items = [\n  { name: 'John', age: 25 },\n  { name: 'Jane', age: 30 },\n  { name: 'Bob', age: 20 },\n]\n\nfunction App() {\n  const { items: sortedItems, term, setTerm, sortConfig, setSortConfig, requestSort } = useSearchAndSort(items)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input type=\"text\" value={term} onChange={(e) => setTerm(e.target.value)} />\n      <button onClick={() => requestSort('name')}>Sort by Name</button>\n      <button onClick={() => requestSort('age')}>Sort by Age</button>\n      <ul>\n        {sortedItems.map((item) => (\n          <li key={item.name}>\n            {item.name} - {item.age}\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `useSearchAndSort` hook is used to search and sort an array of objects that contain a `name` and an `age` property. The `term` state is used to store the current search term, and the `setTerm` function is used to update the search term. The `requestSort` function is used to request a sort based on the `name` or `age` property. The `sortedItems` array is the sorted and searched array of items.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines a custom React hook called `useSearchAndSort` that takes in an array of items, search options, and sort options, and returns an object with sorted items, search term, and sort configuration.\n\n2. What external libraries does this code use?\n    \n    This code uses two external libraries: `@ethersproject/bignumber` for handling big numbers, and `fuse.js` for fuzzy searching.\n\n3. What is the role of the `getNested` function?\n    \n    The `getNested` function is a helper function that takes in an object, a path string, and a separator, and returns the value of the nested property specified by the path string. It replaces square brackets with the separator and splits the path string to traverse the object. If the property is not found, it returns `undefined`.",
