  "summary": "The code above is a TypeScript module that exports a single function called `useIsSwapUnsupported`. This function takes two optional parameters, `currencyIn` and `currencyOut`, which are both of type `Currency`. The purpose of this function is to determine whether a given input or output currency can be traded in the interface. \n\nThe function makes use of the `useUnsupportedTokens` hook from the `./Tokens` module, which returns a dictionary of unsupported tokens. The function then uses the `useMemo` hook from the `react` library to memoize the result of the function. \n\nThe function checks whether the `unsupportedTokens` dictionary has been loaded and whether either the `currencyIn` or `currencyOut` is a token that is on the list of unsupported tokens. If either of these conditions is true, the function returns `true`, indicating that the swap is unsupported. Otherwise, it returns `false`.\n\nThis function is likely used in the larger project to determine whether a given swap is supported by the interface. It could be used, for example, to disable a swap button or display a warning message to the user if the swap is not supported. \n\nHere is an example of how this function could be used in a React component:\n\n```jsx\nimport { useIsSwapUnsupported } from '@zoolabs/zoo'\n\nfunction SwapButton({ currencyIn, currencyOut }) {\n  const isUnsupported = useIsSwapUnsupported(currencyIn, currencyOut)\n\n  return (\n    <button disabled={isUnsupported}>\n      {isUnsupported ? 'Unsupported' : 'Swap'}\n    </button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `SwapButton` component takes two currency props, `currencyIn` and `currencyOut`. It then calls the `useIsSwapUnsupported` function to determine whether the swap is unsupported. If it is unsupported, the button is disabled and displays the text \"Unsupported\". Otherwise, the button is enabled and displays the text \"Swap\".",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useIsSwapUnsupported` function?\n- The function returns a boolean indicating whether the input currency or output currency cannot be traded in the interface.\n\n2. What is the `useMemo` hook used for in this code?\n- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of the function and avoid unnecessary re-renders.\n\n3. What is the `useUnsupportedTokens` hook used for in this code?\n- The `useUnsupportedTokens` hook is used to retrieve a list of unsupported tokens from the application state.",
