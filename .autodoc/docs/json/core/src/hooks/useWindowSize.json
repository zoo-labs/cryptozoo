  "summary": "The code above is a custom React hook that allows developers to get the current size of the browser window. It uses the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks from React to manage state and side effects. \n\nThe `useWindowSize` function is the main function that is exported from this module. When called, it returns an object with the current width and height of the browser window. \n\nThe `getSize` function is a helper function that returns an object with the current width and height of the browser window. It checks if the `window` object is available (i.e., if the code is running in a browser environment) and returns the appropriate values. If the `window` object is not available (i.e., if the code is running in a non-browser environment), it returns `undefined` for both width and height. \n\nThe `useEffect` hook is used to add an event listener to the `window` object for the `resize` event. When the window is resized, the `handleResize` function is called, which updates the state of the `windowSize` variable using the `setWindowSize` function. \n\nThe `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the `windowSize` variable. It is initialized with the result of the `getSize` function, which is called once when the component is mounted. \n\nOverall, this hook can be used in any React component to get the current size of the browser window. For example, it could be used to conditionally render different components based on the size of the window, or to dynamically adjust the layout of a component based on the window size. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { useWindowSize } from 'zoo'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { width, height } = useWindowSize()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Window width: {width}</p>\n      <p>Window height: {height}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What does the `useWindowSize` function do?\n- The `useWindowSize` function is a custom React hook that returns the current size of the browser window as an object with `width` and `height` properties.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `getSize` function?\n- The `getSize` function returns an object with the current `width` and `height` of the browser window, or `undefined` if the code is not running in a browser environment.\n\n3. Why is the `isClient` variable used in this code?\n- The `isClient` variable is used to check if the code is running in a browser environment by checking if the `window` object exists. This is necessary because the `window` object is not available in server-side rendering or other non-browser environments.",
