  "summary": "This code exports various custom hooks and functions from the `zoo` project. These hooks and functions are designed to be used in conjunction with the larger project to provide additional functionality and simplify certain tasks.\n\nThe `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to retrieve the active Web3 provider and account from the user's browser. This is useful for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and executing transactions.\n\nThe `useApproveCallback` hook is used to generate a callback function for approving a token transfer. This is commonly used in decentralized exchanges and other applications that require token transfers.\n\nThe `useBentoBox` hook is used to interact with the BentoBox smart contract, which is a decentralized finance protocol that allows for efficient token storage and transfer.\n\nThe `useBentoBoxAllowance` hook is used to retrieve the current allowance for a specific token in the BentoBox. This is useful for determining whether a user has approved a token transfer.\n\nThe `useContract` functions provide a simple way to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These functions abstract away some of the complexity of interacting with smart contracts and provide a more user-friendly interface.\n\nThe `useFuse` hook is used to perform fuzzy text searching on an array of objects. This is useful for implementing search functionality in the larger project.\n\nThe `useSortableData` hook is used to sort an array of objects based on a specified key. This is useful for displaying data in a table or list.\n\nThe `useUSDCPrice` hook is used to retrieve the current price of USDC, which is a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. This is useful for displaying prices and performing calculations in the larger project.\n\nOverall, these hooks and functions provide a variety of useful functionality for the `zoo` project and can be used to simplify development and improve the user experience. Here is an example of how the `useActiveWeb3React` hook might be used:\n\n```\nimport { useActiveWeb3React } from 'zoo'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { account } = useActiveWeb3React()\n\n  // Use the account to interact with the Ethereum blockchain\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useActiveWeb3React` function and how is it used?\n   - The `useActiveWeb3React` function is exported as the default from the `useActiveWeb3React` module. It likely provides a hook for accessing the active Web3 provider in the current context.\n\n2. What is the `useApproveCallback` function and how does it relate to the `ApprovalState` enum?\n   - The `useApproveCallback` function and `ApprovalState` enum are both exported from the `useApproveCallback` module. They likely provide a hook for handling approval of a transaction and tracking the approval state.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useBentoBox` and `useBentoBoxAllowance` functions?\n   - The `useBentoBox` and `useBentoBoxAllowance` functions are both exported from their respective modules. They likely provide hooks for interacting with the BentoBox smart contract, possibly for depositing and withdrawing assets.",
