  "summary": "The code above is a custom React hook that parses the query string parameters from the URL and returns them as an object. It uses the `qs` library to parse the query string and the `useMemo` hook to memoize the result.\n\nThe `useParsedQueryString` hook takes no arguments and returns an object of type `ParsedQs`, which is a type definition from the `qs` library. This object contains the parsed query string parameters as key-value pairs.\n\nTo use this hook, it must be imported into a React component and called like any other hook. For example:\n\n```\nimport useParsedQueryString from './useParsedQueryString'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const queryParams = useParsedQueryString()\n\n  // do something with queryParams\n\n  return (\n    // JSX code\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThe `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of parsing the query string. This means that if the `search` string (which contains the query string parameters) has not changed, the hook will return the same object as before, without re-parsing the query string. This can improve performance in cases where the query string is frequently accessed but rarely changes.\n\nThe `parse` function from the `qs` library is used to parse the query string. It takes two optional arguments: `parseArrays` and `ignoreQueryPrefix`. The `parseArrays` argument specifies whether to parse arrays in the query string as arrays or as objects with numeric keys. The `ignoreQueryPrefix` argument specifies whether to ignore the leading '?' character in the query string.\n\nOverall, this hook provides a convenient way to access and parse query string parameters in a React component. It can be used in conjunction with other hooks, such as `useLocation` from the `react-router-dom` library, to build more complex functionality.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useMemo` hook in this code?\n   - The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of parsing the query string, so that it is only re-computed when the `search` value changes.\n2. Why is the `parseArrays` option set to `false` in the `parse` function?\n   - The `parseArrays` option is set to `false` to ensure that query string parameters with multiple values are not parsed into arrays, but instead are represented as strings.\n3. What is the expected format of the `location.search` value?\n   - The `location.search` value is expected to be a string representing the query string portion of a URL, including the leading `?` character.",
