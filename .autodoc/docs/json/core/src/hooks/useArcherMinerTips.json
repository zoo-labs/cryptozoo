  "summary": "The code is a custom React hook called `useArcherMinerTips` that fetches gas prices from the Archer API and returns them as an object with a `status` and `data` property. The `status` property indicates the current state of the hook, which can be one of three values: `idle`, `fetching`, or `fetched`. The `data` property is an object that contains gas prices for different transaction speeds.\n\nThe hook uses the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks from React to manage state and side effects. When the component mounts, the hook fetches gas prices from the Archer API using the `fetch` function. The API endpoint is determined by the `ChainId` from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, which is obtained using the `useActiveWeb3React` hook. If the `ChainId` is `MAINNET`, the hook fetches gas prices. If the `ChainId` is not `MAINNET`, the hook does nothing.\n\nOnce the gas prices are fetched, the hook updates the `data` state with the response data and sets the `status` state to `fetched`. If there is an error fetching the gas prices, the `status` state is set to `idle`.\n\nThe `data` object contains gas prices for different transaction speeds, which are represented as strings. The keys of the object are `immediate`, `rapid`, `fast`, `standard`, `slow`, `slower`, and `slowest`. These keys correspond to different gas prices based on the speed of the transaction. For example, a transaction with a gas price of `immediate` will be processed faster than a transaction with a gas price of `slowest`.\n\nThis hook can be used in the larger project to fetch gas prices for transactions and determine the appropriate gas price to use based on the desired transaction speed. For example, if a user wants to send a transaction quickly, they can use the `rapid` gas price. If they are willing to wait longer for the transaction to be processed, they can use the `slow` or `slower` gas price. The `useArcherMinerTips` hook abstracts away the complexity of fetching gas prices from the Archer API and provides a simple interface for accessing gas prices in the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport useArcherMinerTips from './useArcherMinerTips'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { status, data } = useArcherMinerTips()\n\n  if (status === 'fetching') {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  if (status === 'fetched') {\n    return (\n      <div>\n        <p>Immediate: {data.immediate}</p>\n        <p>Rapid: {data.rapid}</p>\n        <p>Fast: {data.fast}</p>\n        <p>Standard: {data.standard}</p>\n        <p>Slow: {data.slow}</p>\n        <p>Slower: {data.slower}</p>\n        <p>Slowest: {data.slowest}</p>\n      </div>\n    )\n  }\n\n  return null\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code defines a custom React hook called `useArcherMinerTips` that fetches gas prices from an API and returns them as an object. It solves the problem of needing to fetch gas prices in a standardized way across the application.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on the `react` library, as well as the `@zoolabs/zdk` library for the `ChainId` type. It also imports a constant `ARCHER_GAS_URI` from a configuration file.\n\n3. What is the expected behavior of this code if the `chainId` is not `ChainId.MAINNET`?\n- If the `chainId` is not `ChainId.MAINNET`, the `fetchData` function will not be called and the `status` and `data` values will remain at their initial states of `'idle'` and the default gas price values, respectively.",
