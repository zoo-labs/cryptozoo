  "summary": "The code defines a custom React hook called `useAllowance` that returns the allowance of a given ERC20 token for the current user's account. The hook takes a single argument, `tokenAddress`, which is the address of the ERC20 token contract.\n\nThe hook uses several other hooks and libraries to accomplish its task. The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to get the current user's Ethereum account. The `useBentoBoxContract` and `useContract` hooks are used to get instances of the BentoBox and ERC20 token contracts, respectively. The `getAddress` function from the `@ethersproject/address` library is used to convert the `tokenAddress` to a checksummed address.\n\nOnce the necessary contracts and addresses are obtained, the hook fetches the current allowance for the user's account using the `allowance` function of the ERC20 token contract. The allowance is then formatted as a `Fraction` using the `Fraction.from` method, which takes a `BigNumber` and a divisor. In this case, the divisor is `10^18`, since ERC20 tokens have 18 decimal places. The formatted allowance is then stored in state using the `setAllowance` function.\n\nThe hook also sets up an interval to periodically refresh the allowance every 10 seconds. This is done using the `setInterval` function in the `useEffect` hook. The interval is cleared when the component unmounts using the `clearInterval` function.\n\nOverall, this hook is useful for any part of the project that needs to check the current allowance of an ERC20 token for the user's account. For example, it could be used in a component that displays the user's current token balances and allowances for various tokens. Here is an example usage of the hook:\n\n```\nimport useAllowance from '../hooks/useAllowance'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const allowance = useAllowance('0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890')\n  return <div>Current allowance: {allowance}</div>\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n- This code exports a custom hook called `useAllowance` which takes a token address as input and returns the allowance of that token for the current user's account.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external dependencies including `react`, `@ethersproject/bignumber`, `@ethersproject/address`, and `../hooks/useContract` and `../hooks/useActiveWeb3React` which are custom hooks defined elsewhere in the project.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `fetchAllowance` function?\n- The `fetchAllowance` function is an asynchronous function that fetches the allowance of a token for the current user's account and updates the `allowance` state variable with the formatted value of the allowance. It is called on mount and every 10 seconds thereafter.",
