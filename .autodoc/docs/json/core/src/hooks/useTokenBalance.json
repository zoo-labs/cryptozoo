  "summary": "The code defines a React hook called `useTokenBalance` that is used to retrieve the balance of a given ERC20 token for a specific Ethereum account. The hook takes a single argument, `tokenAddress`, which is the address of the ERC20 token contract. \n\nThe hook uses several other hooks and functions to retrieve and manage the balance. It uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the current Ethereum account and network ID, and the `useBlockNumber` hook to get the current block number. It also uses the `useContract` hook to get a reference to the ERC20 token contract, and the `useTransactionStatus` hook to track the status of any transactions related to the balance retrieval.\n\nThe `useTokenBalance` hook returns an object with two properties: `value` and `decimals`. `value` is a `BigNumber` object representing the balance of the ERC20 token for the specified account, and `decimals` is the number of decimal places used by the token. \n\nThe hook first initializes the balance state to zero and 18 decimal places. It then fetches the balance using the `fetchBalance` function, which retrieves the balance from the ERC20 token contract using the `balanceOf` and `decimals` functions. If the token is the native token of the current network (e.g. ETH on the Ethereum mainnet), the hook retrieves the balance using the `getBalance` function instead. If any errors occur during the balance retrieval, the hook logs the error and returns a balance of zero.\n\nThe hook also sets up an effect that runs whenever the Ethereum account, token contract, or other relevant state variables change. This effect calls the `fetchBalance` function to update the balance state.\n\nOverall, this hook can be used to retrieve the balance of any ERC20 token for a specific Ethereum account in a React application. It can be used in conjunction with other hooks and components to build more complex applications that interact with ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum network.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a React hook called `useTokenBalance` that fetches the balance of a given ERC20 token for the connected wallet address.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n   - This code relies on several external dependencies, including `react`, `@ethersproject/bignumber`, `@ethersproject/contracts`, `@zoolabs/zdk`, and `../constants/abis/erc20.json`.\n\n3. Why does the code use useCallback and useEffect?\n   - The code uses `useCallback` to memoize the `fetchBalance` function and prevent unnecessary re-renders. It uses `useEffect` to trigger the `fetchBalance` function whenever the `account`, `setBalance`, `currentBlockNumber`, `currentTransactionStatus`, `tokenAddress`, or `tokenContract` variables change.",
