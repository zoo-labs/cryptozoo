  "summary": "This code exports various constants and variables that are used throughout the zoo project. \n\nThe `POOL_DENY` constant is an array of pool IDs that are not allowed to be used in the project. \n\nThe `AVERAGE_BLOCK_TIME_IN_SECS` constant is the average block time in seconds, which is used to avoid ongoing proposals past the displayed time. \n\nThe `MERKLE_ROOT` constant is the URL of the merkle root used for vesting. \n\nThe `NetworkContextName` constant is the name of the network context. \n\nThe `INITIAL_ALLOWED_SLIPPAGE` constant is the default allowed slippage in basis points. \n\nThe `DEFAULT_DEADLINE_FROM_NOW` constant is the default deadline from now, denominated in seconds. \n\nThe `BIG_INT_SECONDS_IN_WEEK` constant is the number of seconds in a week, represented as a big integer. \n\nThe `BIG_INT_ZERO` constant is a big integer with a value of zero. \n\nThe `ONE_BIPS` constant is one basis point, represented as a percent. \n\nThe `BIPS_BASE` constant is a big integer with a value of 10,000, which is the base for basis points. \n\nThe `ALLOWED_PRICE_IMPACT_LOW`, `ALLOWED_PRICE_IMPACT_MEDIUM`, and `ALLOWED_PRICE_IMPACT_HIGH` constants are used for warning states when the price impact exceeds a certain threshold. \n\nThe `PRICE_IMPACT_WITHOUT_FEE_CONFIRM_MIN` constant is the minimum price impact without a fee that requires the user to confirm the transaction. \n\nThe `BLOCKED_PRICE_IMPACT_NON_EXPERT` constant is the maximum price impact for non-expert mode. \n\nThe `MIN_ETH` constant is the minimum amount of ETH that can be sent. \n\nThe `BETTER_TRADE_LESS_HOPS_THRESHOLD` constant is the threshold for better trades with less hops. \n\nThe `ZERO_PERCENT` and `ONE_HUNDRED_PERCENT` constants are used to represent zero and one hundred percent, respectively. \n\nThe `BLOCKED_ADDRESSES` constant is an array of blocked addresses. \n\nThe `ANALYTICS_URL` constant is an object that maps chain IDs to analytics URLs. \n\nThe `EIP_1559_ACTIVATION_BLOCK` constant is an object that maps chain IDs to EIP-1559 activation blocks. \n\nThese constants and variables are used throughout the zoo project to provide default values and other configuration options. For example, the `INITIAL_ALLOWED_SLIPPAGE` constant is used to set the default allowed slippage for trades, while the `BLOCKED_ADDRESSES` constant is used to block certain addresses from being used in the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `POOL_DENY` array?\n- The `POOL_DENY` array contains a list of pool IDs that are denied for use in the project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `MERKLE_ROOT` constant?\n- The `MERKLE_ROOT` constant contains the URL for the merkle root used for vesting in the project.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ANALYTICS_URL` object?\n- The `ANALYTICS_URL` object contains URLs for analytics pages for different chain IDs used in the project.",
