  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for retrieving contract information from a JSON file and organizing it into a usable format. The JSON file is imported at the beginning of the file and contains contract information for various networks. \n\nThe first part of the code creates two arrays: `networkIds` and `networkNames`. `networkIds` is an array of the keys in the `contractsJSON` object, which correspond to the network IDs. `networkNames` is an array of all the contract names for all networks. \n\nThe next part of the code creates an object called `contractsByChainIdAndNetwork`. This object is organized by network ID and contains an object for each network that contains all the contracts for that network. Each contract is represented by an object that contains the contract's bytecode, ABI, and other information. \n\nThe final part of the code defines two functions: `getContractsByKey` and two exports: `addresses` and `abis`. `getContractsByKey` takes a string argument `key` and returns an object that contains all the contracts for all networks organized by contract name and the value of the specified `key`. The `addresses` export is the result of calling `getContractsByKey` with the argument `'address'`, and the `abis` export is the result of calling `getContractsByKey` with the argument `'abi'`. \n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to retrieve contract information and use it in other parts of the codebase. For example, the `addresses` and `abis` exports could be used to interact with the contracts on the various networks.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `contracts.json` file being imported at the beginning of the code?\n- The `contracts.json` file is being imported to provide data for the creation of `contractsByChainIdAndNetwork` object.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `getContractsByKey` function?\n- The `getContractsByKey` function is used to extract specific data from the `contractsByChainIdAndNetwork` object and return it in a specific format.\n\n3. Why does the code include a comment that says \"By the way, this function is terrible. Change it at your own peril\"?\n- The comment is a warning to other developers that the `getContractsByKey` function is not well-written and should be refactored with caution.",
