  "summary": "The `Web3Status` component is responsible for displaying the user's wallet status and allowing them to connect to a wallet. It imports several dependencies such as React, `useMemo`, `AbstractConnector`, `Image`, `Loader`, `styled-components`, `useLingui`, `useTheme`, `UserIcon`, and `HatchEggModal`. It also imports several functions and constants from other files in the project such as `SUPPORTED_WALLETS`, `injected`, `isTransactionRecent`, `useAllTransactions`, `TransactionDetails`, `NetworkContextName`, `shortenAddress`, `useENSName`, and `useWalletModalToggle`.\n\nThe `Web3Status` component is a wrapper for the `Web3StatusInner` component, which is responsible for rendering the user's wallet status. The `Web3StatusInner` component uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the user's account and connector. If the user is connected to a wallet, it displays their account address or ENS name, along with an icon representing their wallet type. If the user has pending transactions, it displays the number of pending transactions and a loading spinner. If the user is not connected to a wallet, it displays a button to connect to a wallet.\n\nThe `Web3Status` component also renders a `WalletModal` component, which displays the user's pending and confirmed transactions and allows them to cancel pending transactions. The `WalletModal` component is only rendered if the user is connected to a wallet.\n\nOverall, the `Web3Status` component is an important part of the project's user interface, as it allows users to connect to a wallet and view their transaction status. It is used in several places throughout the project, such as in the header and footer of the website.",
