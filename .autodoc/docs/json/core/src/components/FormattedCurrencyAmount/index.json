  "summary": "This code is a module that exports a React component called `FormattedCurrencyAmount`. The component takes in two props: `currencyAmount` and `significantDigits`. The `currencyAmount` prop is an object of type `CurrencyAmount` that represents a certain amount of a specific currency. The `significantDigits` prop is an optional number that determines how many significant digits should be displayed in the output.\n\nThe component first defines a constant called `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` which is a `Fraction` object representing the minimum amount of currency that can be displayed. This is set to 1/1000000.\n\nThe component then returns a JSX expression that displays the formatted currency amount. If the `currencyAmount` prop is equal to 0, the component displays \"0\". If the `currencyAmount` prop is greater than the `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` constant, the component displays the currency amount with the number of significant digits specified by the `significantDigits` prop. If the `currencyAmount` prop is less than or equal to the `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` constant, the component displays \"<\" followed by the `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` constant formatted with 1 significant digit.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that deals with currencies and requires a way to format currency amounts for display. For example, if the project has a shopping cart feature that displays the total cost of items in the cart, this component can be used to format the currency amount for display. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { Currency, CurrencyAmount } from \"@zoolabs/zdk\";\nimport FormattedCurrencyAmount from \"./FormattedCurrencyAmount\";\n\nconst currencyAmount = new CurrencyAmount(Currency.USD, \"1000000000000000000\");\n\nfunction ShoppingCartTotal() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      Total: <FormattedCurrencyAmount currencyAmount={currencyAmount} significantDigits={2} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `FormattedCurrencyAmount` component is used to format the `currencyAmount` object with 2 significant digits for display in a shopping cart total.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `@zoolabs/zdk` import?\n- The `@zoolabs/zdk` import is used to import the `Currency`, `CurrencyAmount`, `Fraction`, and `JSBI` modules from the `zdk` library.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` constant?\n- The `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` constant represents the minimum amount of currency that can be displayed and is set to 1/1000000th of the currency unit.\n\n3. What does the `FormattedCurrencyAmount` function do?\n- The `FormattedCurrencyAmount` function takes in a `currencyAmount` object and an optional `significantDigits` parameter and returns a formatted string representation of the currency amount. If the amount is equal to 0, it returns \"0\". If the amount is greater than the `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN`, it returns the amount formatted to the specified number of significant digits. Otherwise, it returns a string indicating that the amount is less than the minimum displayable amount.",
