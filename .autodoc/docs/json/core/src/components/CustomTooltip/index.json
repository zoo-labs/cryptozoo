  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `CustomTooltip` that wraps the `Tooltip` component from the Material-UI library. The purpose of this component is to provide a customizable tooltip that can be used throughout the larger project. \n\nThe `CustomTooltip` component takes in three props: `title`, `children`, and `center`. The `title` prop is a string that represents the text that will be displayed in the tooltip. The `children` prop is any valid React component that will be wrapped by the tooltip. The `center` prop is an optional boolean that determines whether the tooltip should be centered above the wrapped component or aligned to the left of it.\n\nThe `CustomTooltip` component returns a `Tooltip` component with customized styles and placement based on the props passed in. The `PopperProps` prop is used to customize the styles of the tooltip. In this case, the tooltip has a black background, white text, and a box shadow. The `title` prop is set to the `title` prop passed in to the `CustomTooltip` component. The `placement` prop is set to either \"top\" or \"top-start\" based on the `center` prop passed in.\n\nAn example of how this component could be used in the larger project is to provide additional information or context when hovering over certain elements. For example, if there is a button that performs a specific action, a tooltip could be added to explain what that action does. The `CustomTooltip` component allows for customization of the tooltip's appearance and placement, making it a versatile tool for providing additional information throughout the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<CustomTooltip title=\"Click to save changes\">\n  <Button variant=\"contained\" color=\"primary\" onClick={handleSave}>\n    Save\n  </Button>\n</CustomTooltip>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What external libraries or frameworks are being used in this code?\n- The code is importing the `Button` and `Tooltip` components from the `@mui/material` library, and is also using the `React` library.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `CustomTooltip` component?\n- The `CustomTooltip` component is a custom wrapper around the `Tooltip` component from the `@mui/material` library, which adds some custom styling and behavior to the tooltip.\n\n3. What props can be passed to the `CustomTooltip` component?\n- The `CustomTooltip` component accepts three props: `title` (a string that specifies the tooltip text), `children` (any valid React node that will be wrapped by the tooltip), and `center` (an optional boolean that determines whether the tooltip should be centered above the wrapped content).",
