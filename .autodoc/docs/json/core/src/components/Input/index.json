  "summary": "The code above is a module that exports an object called `Input`. This object contains three properties: `Address`, `Numeric`, and `Percent`. Each of these properties is a reference to a module that is imported from a file located in the `zoo` project. \n\nThe `Address` module is likely used to represent a physical address, while the `Numeric` module is likely used to represent numerical values. The `Percent` module is likely used to represent percentages. \n\nBy exporting these modules as properties of the `Input` object, other modules within the `zoo` project can easily import and use them. For example, a module that needs to represent a physical address could import the `Address` module like this:\n\n```\nimport { Address } from 'zoo/Input'\n```\n\nThis code would import the `Address` module from the `Input` object exported by the `zoo` project. The module could then use the `Address` module to represent physical addresses.\n\nOverall, this code is a simple way to organize and export commonly used modules within the `zoo` project. By exporting them as properties of an object, other modules can easily import and use them without having to worry about the specific file paths or module names.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code exports an object called `Input` that contains three modules: `Address`, `Percent`, and `Numeric`.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n   This code depends on three other modules located in the same directory: `Address.js`, `Numeric.js`, and `Percent.js`.\n\n3. How can this code be used in other parts of the project?\n   Other parts of the project can import the `Input` object from this module and use its properties (`Address`, `Percent`, and `Numeric`) as needed. For example: `import { Address } from './zoo/Input'`.",
