  "summary": "The code defines two React components, `MinimalPositionCard` and `FullPositionCard`, which are used to display information about a liquidity pool position. The components take a `pair` object as a prop, which is an instance of the `Pair` class from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library. The `pair` object represents a pair of tokens in a liquidity pool, and contains information about the tokens, such as their addresses, symbols, and decimals, as well as the liquidity token for the pool.\n\nThe `MinimalPositionCard` component displays basic information about the position, including the pool tokens held by the user, the symbols of the tokens in the pool, and the amount of each token deposited in the pool. If the `showUnwrapped` prop is set to `true`, the component displays information about the underlying tokens instead of the wrapped tokens. The component also calculates and displays the user's pool share as a percentage of the total pool tokens.\n\nThe `FullPositionCard` component displays additional information about the position, including the total pool tokens held by the user, the amount of pool tokens staked in a rewards pool (if provided), and the user's pool share as a percentage of the total pool tokens. The component also provides buttons to add or remove liquidity from the pool.\n\nBoth components use hooks from the `@lingui/react`, `@headlessui/react`, and `next/router` libraries to handle localization, transitions, and navigation, respectively. They also use hooks from the `useActiveWeb3React` and `useTokenBalance` custom hooks to interact with the user's wallet and retrieve their token balances. The `useTotalSupply` hook is used to retrieve the total supply of the liquidity token for the pool.\n\nOverall, these components provide a simple and intuitive way for users to view and manage their liquidity pool positions. They can be used in conjunction with other components in the `zoo` project to create a comprehensive user interface for interacting with liquidity pools.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PositionCardProps` interface?\n- The `PositionCardProps` interface defines the props that can be passed to the `MinimalPositionCard` and `FullPositionCard` components.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `showUnwrapped` prop in the `MinimalPositionCard` component?\n- The `showUnwrapped` prop determines whether to display the wrapped or unwrapped version of the tokens in the liquidity pool.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useTotalSupply` hook?\n- The `useTotalSupply` hook is used to retrieve the total supply of a given token, which is used to calculate the user's pool share in the liquidity pool.",
