  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders the account details of a user's wallet. It imports various dependencies such as React, Image, and Button from different modules. It also imports some functions and constants from other files such as `getExplorerLink` and `SUPPORTED_WALLETS`. \n\nThe component takes in several props such as `toggleWalletModal`, `pendingTransactions`, `confirmedTransactions`, `ENSName`, and `openOptions`. It then uses these props to render the account details of the user's wallet. \n\nThe component first uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the current chain ID, account, and connector of the user's wallet. It then uses the `useSelector` hook to get the user's ZOO balance from the Redux store. \n\nThe component then defines several functions such as `formatConnectorName` and `getStatusIcon` that are used to format and display the user's wallet connector and status icon. \n\nThe component then renders the user's account details such as their wallet address, balance, and recent transactions. It also provides buttons to disconnect the wallet, change the wallet, view the wallet on an explorer, and copy the wallet address. \n\nThe component also defines a `WalletIcon` component that renders the icon of the user's wallet connector. It also defines a `renderTransactions` function that renders the user's recent transactions. \n\nOverall, this component is an important part of the larger project as it provides users with a way to view and manage their wallet details and transactions. It can be used in various parts of the project such as the wallet modal and the dashboard. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport AccountDetails from \"./components/AccountDetails\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <AccountDetails \n        toggleWalletModal={() => console.log(\"Toggle wallet modal\")}\n        pendingTransactions={[\"0x123abc\", \"0x456def\"]}\n        confirmedTransactions={[\"0x789ghi\"]}\n        ENSName=\"mywallet.eth\"\n        openOptions={() => console.log(\"Open wallet options\")}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
