  "summary": "The `CopyHelper` component is a reusable React component that provides a UI for copying text to the clipboard. It is designed to be used in other parts of the `zoo` project where copying text is required. \n\nThe component imports two icons from the `@heroicons/react/outline` package: `CheckCircleIcon` and `ClipboardCopyIcon`. It also imports the `useCopyClipboard` hook from a custom `useCopyClipboard` module, the `classNames` function from a custom `functions` module, and the `Typography` component from a custom `Typography` module. Additionally, it imports the `useLingui` hook and `t` function from the `@lingui/react` and `@lingui/macro` packages respectively.\n\nThe `CopyHelper` component takes three props: `className`, `toCopy`, and `children`. `className` is an optional string that can be used to add additional CSS classes to the component. `toCopy` is a required string that represents the text to be copied to the clipboard. `children` is an optional prop that can be used to pass in additional React components to be rendered alongside the copy icon.\n\nThe component uses the `useCopyClipboard` hook to manage the state of whether or not the text has been copied to the clipboard. It also uses the `useLingui` hook to provide internationalization support for the \"Copied\" text that is displayed when the text is successfully copied.\n\nThe component renders a `div` element with a `classNames` function that combines the default classes with any additional classes passed in via the `className` prop. The `onClick` event is set to call the `setCopied` function with the `toCopy` prop as an argument when the component is clicked.\n\nIf the text has been successfully copied, the component renders a `div` element with the \"Copied\" text and a `CheckCircleIcon`. If the text has not been copied, the component renders a `div` element with any additional components passed in via the `children` prop and a `ClipboardCopyIcon`.\n\nOverall, the `CopyHelper` component provides a simple and reusable UI for copying text to the clipboard, with support for internationalization and customization via the `className` and `children` props. An example usage of this component would be in a form where a user needs to copy a generated code or URL to the clipboard.",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n   - This code exports a React component called `CopyHelper` that provides a UI for copying text to the clipboard and displaying a success message upon successful copy.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code rely on?\n   - This code relies on several external dependencies, including `@heroicons/react/outline`, `react`, `useCopyClipboard`, `../../functions`, `../Typography`, `@lingui/react`, and `@lingui/macro`.\n\n3. What props does the `CopyHelper` component accept?\n   - The `CopyHelper` component accepts three props: `className` (optional), `toCopy` (required), and `children` (optional). The `toCopy` prop specifies the text to be copied to the clipboard, and the `children` prop is used to render any additional content alongside the copy icon.",
