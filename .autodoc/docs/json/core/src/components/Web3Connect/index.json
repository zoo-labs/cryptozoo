  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a button for connecting a user's web3 wallet to the application. The component imports a Button component and Activity icon from other files. It also imports functions from various hooks and libraries such as `useLingui`, `useWalletModalToggle`, and `useActiveWeb3React`.\n\nThe Web3Connect component takes in several props such as `color`, `size`, `className`, and `title`. If there is an error with the user's web3 connection, the component will render a div with an Activity icon and a message indicating the error. If there is no error, the component will render a Button component with the `title` prop as its label.\n\nThe purpose of this component is to provide a simple and intuitive way for users to connect their web3 wallets to the application. It can be used in various parts of the application where web3 connectivity is required, such as in trading or staking interfaces. The component can be customized with different colors, sizes, and styles to fit the design of the application.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\n<Web3Connect\n  color=\"blue\"\n  size=\"md\"\n  className=\"my-4\"\n  title=\"Connect Wallet\"\n/>\n```",
