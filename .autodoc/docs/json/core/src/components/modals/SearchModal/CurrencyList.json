  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `CurrencyList` that renders a list of currencies. It imports several dependencies, including `@zoolabs/zdk`, `react`, `react-window`, and `styled-components`. \n\nThe `CurrencyList` component takes several props, including an array of `currencies`, a `selectedCurrency`, and a callback function `onCurrencySelect` that is called when a currency is selected. It also takes a `height` prop that determines the height of the list, and several other optional props.\n\nThe `CurrencyList` component renders a `FixedSizeList` component from `react-window`, which is a high-performance list component that only renders the items that are currently visible on the screen. The `FixedSizeList` component renders a list of `CurrencyRow` components, which render individual rows in the list.\n\nEach `CurrencyRow` component renders a single currency in the list. It takes several props, including the `currency` to render, a callback function `onSelect` that is called when the currency is selected, and a boolean `isSelected` that indicates whether the currency is currently selected. It also takes several other optional props.\n\nThe `CurrencyRow` component renders a `MenuItem` component from `@mui/material`, which is a Material UI component that represents a single item in a menu. The `MenuItem` component contains several child components, including a `CurrencyLogo` component, which renders the logo for the currency, a `div` that displays the currency symbol and name, and a `Balance` component that displays the balance of the currency.\n\nThe `Balance` component takes a `balance` prop, which is a `CurrencyAmount` object that represents the balance of the currency. It renders the balance as a string, using the `toSignificant` method to format the number.\n\nThe `CurrencyList` component also defines several other components, including `BreakLineComponent`, which renders a line that separates the active token list from the inactive token lists, and `CurrencyRow`, which renders a single row in the list.\n\nOverall, this code defines a reusable component that can be used to render a list of currencies in a React application. It uses several third-party libraries to achieve high performance and a consistent look and feel.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CurrencyList` component?\n- The `CurrencyList` component is used to display a list of currencies and their balances, as well as allow the user to select a currency.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `BREAK_LINE` constant and the `isBreakLine` function?\n- The `BREAK_LINE` constant is used to represent a break line in the list of currencies, separating active and inactive token lists. The `isBreakLine` function is used to check if a given item in the list is a break line.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useCombinedActiveList` hook?\n- The `useCombinedActiveList` hook is used to retrieve the list of selected tokens from the user's wallet and any active token lists.",
