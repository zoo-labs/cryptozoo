  "summary": "This code exports three items from the `zoo` project's `ToastContainer` module: the `ToastContainer` component, the `toastTypes` object, and several types related to toasts. \n\nThe `ToastContainer` component is a container for displaying toast notifications to users. Toast notifications are small, temporary messages that appear on the screen to provide feedback or information to the user. The `ToastContainer` component is customizable and can be styled to fit the design of the application. \n\nThe `toastTypes` object contains constants that define the different types of toast notifications that can be displayed. These types include success, error, warning, and info. Developers can use these constants to create their own custom toast notifications or to style the default notifications provided by the `ToastContainer` component. \n\nThe types exported by this module include `ToastContainerProps`, which defines the props that can be passed to the `ToastContainer` component, and `Toast`, which defines the shape of a single toast notification. Additionally, the `Types as ToastTypes` statement exports an alias for the `types` object as `ToastTypes`. This allows developers to import the `toastTypes` object using a more descriptive name. \n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way for developers to use and customize toast notifications in their applications. Here is an example of how the `ToastContainer` component and `toastTypes` object could be used in a React application:\n\n```\nimport { ToastContainer, toastTypes } from 'zoo';\n\nfunction App() {\n  const handleButtonClick = () => {\n    // Display a success toast notification\n    toastTypes.success('Button clicked!');\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={handleButtonClick}>Click me</button>\n      <ToastContainer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `ToastContainer` and `Toast` components?** The `ToastContainer` component is likely responsible for rendering and managing toast notifications, while the `Toast` component represents an individual toast notification. \n2. **What is the `types` export and what does it contain?** The `types` export likely contains various type definitions related to toast notifications, such as the shape of a `Toast` object or the available types of toast notifications. \n3. **What is the significance of the `Types` export in the type definition?** The `Types` export is likely an alias for the `toastTypes` export, allowing developers to import the available toast types using a more descriptive name.",
