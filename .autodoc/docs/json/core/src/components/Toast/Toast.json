  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a toast notification. The toast notification is a small message that appears on the screen to provide feedback to the user. The component is imported from the `zoo` project and uses several other React components and libraries.\n\nThe `Toast` component takes several props, including `toast`, `onRemove`, `style`, and `ttl`. The `toast` prop contains the data for the toast notification, including the `id`, `title`, `description`, `type`, and `action`. The `onRemove` prop is a callback function that is called when the toast notification is removed. The `style` prop is an object that contains the CSS styles for the toast notification. The `ttl` prop is the time-to-live for the toast notification, which is the amount of time the notification is displayed on the screen.\n\nThe `Toast` component uses the `CSSTransition` component from the `react-transition-group` library to animate the toast notification. The `StyledToast` component is a styled component that contains the CSS styles for the toast notification. The `Alert` component is another component from the `zoo` project that renders an alert message. The `Alert` component takes several props, including `title`, `variant`, and `onClick`. The `variant` prop is not used in this component.\n\nThe `Toast` component uses several hooks, including `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`. The `useCallback` hook is used to memoize the `handleRemove` function, which is called when the toast notification is removed. The `useEffect` hook is used to set a timer for the toast notification and to clear the timer when the component is unmounted. The `useRef` hook is used to create a reference to the `timer` and `removeHandler` variables.\n\nOverall, the `Toast` component is a reusable component that can be used to display toast notifications in the `zoo` project. The component is highly customizable and can be styled and configured to meet the needs of the project. Here is an example of how the `Toast` component can be used in the `zoo` project:\n\n```jsx\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Toast from \"./Toast\";\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const handleRemove = (id) => {\n    console.log(`Toast with id ${id} removed`);\n  };\n\n  const toast = {\n    id: 1,\n    title: \"Hello World\",\n    description: \"This is a toast notification\",\n    type: \"info\",\n    action: {\n      label: \"Undo\",\n      onClick: () => console.log(\"Undo clicked\"),\n    },\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <Toast\n      toast={toast}\n      onRemove={handleRemove}\n      style={{ backgroundColor: \"white\" }}\n      ttl={5000}\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Toast` component?\n   \n   The `Toast` component is used to display a toast notification with a title, description, and optional action button.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `handleMouseEnter` and `handleMouseLeave` functions?\n   \n   The `handleMouseEnter` and `handleMouseLeave` functions are used to pause and resume the timer that controls the duration of the toast notification. When the user hovers over the toast, the timer is paused, and when they leave, the timer is resumed.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `alertTypeMap` object?\n   \n   The `alertTypeMap` object is used to map the `type` property of the `toast` object to a corresponding `TYPE` value from the `../Alert` module. This allows the `Alert` component to display the appropriate styling based on the type of the toast notification.",
