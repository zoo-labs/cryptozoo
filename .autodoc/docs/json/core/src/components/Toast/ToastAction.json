  "summary": "The code above is a React component called `ToastAction` that renders a button with a specific size and text based on the `action` prop passed to it. The purpose of this component is to provide a consistent way to render buttons for actions that are triggered by a toast notification in the larger project.\n\nThe `ToastAction` component imports the `Button` component from the `components` directory and the `getExternalLinkProps` function from the `config` directory. It also imports the `ToastAction` type from a local `types` file.\n\nThe `ToastAction` component takes in a single prop called `action` which is of type `ToastAction`. This prop contains information about the action that should be taken when the button is clicked, including the text to display on the button and the URL to navigate to.\n\nThe `ToastAction` component checks if the URL provided in the `action` prop starts with \"http\". If it does, it renders a `Button` component with the `size` prop set to \"sm\" and the `getExternalLinkProps` function passed as a spread operator. This function provides additional props to the `Button` component to ensure that external links open in a new tab and have appropriate accessibility attributes.\n\nIf the URL provided in the `action` prop does not start with \"http\", the `ToastAction` component renders a `Button` component with the `size` prop set to \"sm\" and the `text` prop set to the `text` property of the `action` prop.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to provide a consistent way to render buttons for actions triggered by toast notifications. For example, if a toast notification is displayed to inform the user that a new version of the app is available, the `ToastAction` component could be used to render a button that navigates to the download page for the new version. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport ToastAction from \"path/to/ToastAction\";\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const handleDownloadClick = () => {\n    // handle download logic\n  };\n\n  const toastAction = {\n    text: \"Download\",\n    url: \"/download\",\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>A new version of the app is available!</p>\n      <ToastAction action={toastAction} onClick={handleDownloadClick} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Button` component being imported from \"components/Button\"?\n- The smart developer might ask why the `Button` component is being imported and what its role is in the `ToastAction` component. \n\n2. What is the `getExternalLinkProps` function and where is it defined?\n- The smart developer might ask what the `getExternalLinkProps` function does and where it is defined in the codebase.\n\n3. Why is the `Link` component from \"react-router-dom\" commented out?\n- The smart developer might ask why the `Link` component is commented out and if there is a reason for not using it in the `ToastAction` component.",
