  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `ComingSoon` that displays a \"Coming Soon\" message and a link to the home page of the website. The component imports the `React` and `useEffect` modules from the `react` package, as well as the `Link` component from the `next/link` package. It also imports an `fadeInOnScroll` function from an `animation` module.\n\nThe `ComingSoon` component renders a div that contains another div with a `flex` layout. The inner div contains a heading that says \"Coming Soon\" and a link to the home page. The `comingSoonRef` variable is a reference to the inner div, which is used to apply an animation effect when the component is scrolled into view. The `useEffect` hook is used to call the `fadeInOnScroll` function with the `comingSoonRef` reference as an argument when the component is mounted.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display a \"Coming Soon\" message on a page that is not yet ready for public access. The animation effect adds a visual cue to draw attention to the message. The `Link` component can be customized to link to any page on the website, not just the home page. Here is an example of how the `ComingSoon` component can be used in a React application:\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport ComingSoon from \"./ComingSoon\";\n\nconst MyPage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>\n      <ComingSoon />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default MyPage;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ComingSoon` component is used to display a message on the `MyPage` component. When the `MyPage` component is rendered, it will display the \"Coming Soon\" message below the heading.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `fadeInOnScroll` function imported from \"animation\"?\n- The `fadeInOnScroll` function is used to animate the `comingSoonRef` element when it is scrolled into view.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `comingSoonRef` variable being assigned to `React.useRef()`?\n- The `comingSoonRef` variable is used to reference the `div` element that contains the \"Coming Soon\" text and the link to the home page. It is assigned to `React.useRef()` so that it can be passed to the `fadeInOnScroll` function to trigger the animation.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Link` component imported from \"next/link\"?\n- The `Link` component is used to create a link to the home page of the website. When clicked, it will navigate the user to the home page without causing a full page refresh.",
