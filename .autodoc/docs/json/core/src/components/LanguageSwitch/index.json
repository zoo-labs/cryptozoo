  "summary": "The `LangSwitcher` component is responsible for rendering a dropdown menu that allows users to switch between different languages on the website. The component is built using the `Menu` and `Transition` components from the `@headlessui/react` library, as well as several other third-party libraries such as `next/router` and `cookie-cutter`.\n\nWhen the component is rendered, it first retrieves the current locale, available locales, and current URL path using the `useRouter` hook from `next/router`. It then renders a button that displays the current language flag and a chevron icon to indicate that it is a dropdown menu. When the button is clicked, the `Menu` component is activated and displays a list of available languages.\n\nEach language in the list is rendered as a `Menu.Item` component, which contains a link to the current page with the `locale` query parameter set to the corresponding language code. When a language is selected, the `cookie-cutter` library is used to set a cookie with the selected language code, which is then used to set the `locale` query parameter on subsequent page loads.\n\nOverall, the `LangSwitcher` component provides a simple and intuitive way for users to switch between different languages on the website. It can be easily integrated into other components and pages using the `import` statement, as shown below:\n\n```\nimport LangSwitcher from './path/to/LangSwitcher'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <LangSwitcher />\n      {/* other content */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a React component that renders a language switcher dropdown menu with flags and language names.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses several external libraries and dependencies, including `@headlessui/react`, `@heroicons/react/solid`, `next/link`, `next/image`, `classnames`, `next/router`, and `cookie-cutter`.\n\n3. What is the format of the `LANG_TO_COUNTRY` object?\n- The `LANG_TO_COUNTRY` object maps language codes to their corresponding country names in various languages. The keys are language codes (e.g. \"en\" for English), and the values are strings representing the country name in that language (e.g. \"English\" for the \"en\" key).",
