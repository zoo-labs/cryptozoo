  "summary": "The `CurrencyInputPanel` component is a reusable UI component that provides an input field for users to enter a token amount and select a token from a dropdown menu. It is used in the larger project to allow users to input token amounts for various actions, such as swapping tokens or providing liquidity.\n\nThe component imports several dependencies, including `React`, `@zoolabs/zdk`, and various other UI components and hooks. It also defines an interface `CurrencyInputPanelProps` that specifies the props that can be passed to the component.\n\nThe component renders a container `div` with a dark background and rounded corners. Within this container, there are two main sections: a token selection section and an input section.\n\nThe token selection section displays a token logo, token symbol, and dropdown arrow. If a `Pair` prop is passed to the component, it displays a double token logo instead. If a `Currency` prop is passed, it displays the corresponding token logo. If neither prop is passed, it displays an animation of a hand selecting a coin. The token symbol is displayed next to the logo, and if the user clicks on the section, a dropdown menu appears allowing the user to select a different token. If the `disableCurrencySelect` prop is set to `true`, the dropdown arrow is not displayed and the user cannot select a different token.\n\nThe input section displays an input field for the user to enter a token amount, as well as a \"Max\" button that sets the input field to the user's maximum token balance. If a `Currency` prop is passed, it displays the user's token balance next to the input field. If a `fiatValue` prop is passed, it displays the fiat value of the user's token balance. If the `hideInput` prop is set to `true`, the input section is not displayed.\n\nThe component also includes a `CurrencySearchModal` that is displayed when the user clicks on the token selection section. This modal allows the user to search for and select a different token.\n\nOverall, the `CurrencyInputPanel` component provides a flexible and reusable UI component for token input and selection. It can be used in various contexts throughout the larger project to allow users to interact with different tokens.",
