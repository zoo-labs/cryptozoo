  "summary": "The `Button` component is a reusable React component that renders a button element with customizable styles. It takes in several props, including `color`, `size`, and `variant`, which determine the appearance of the button. The `color` prop specifies the color scheme of the button, with options including blue, pink, gradient, gray, default, red, green, and indigo. The `size` prop determines the size of the button, with options including xs, sm, lg, default, and none. The `variant` prop determines the type of button, with options including outlined, filled, empty, and link.\n\nThe `Button` component also includes two additional components, `ButtonConfirmed` and `ButtonError`, which are variations of the `Button` component. `ButtonConfirmed` is used to render a button that is confirmed, with a green outline and a checkmark icon. `ButtonError` is used to render a button that indicates an error, with a red color scheme.\n\nThe `Button` component uses the `classNames` function from the `functions` module to dynamically generate class names based on the props passed to the component. These class names are used to apply the appropriate styles to the button element.\n\nOverall, the `Button` component is a flexible and customizable component that can be used throughout the project to render buttons with consistent styles. Here is an example of how the `Button` component can be used:\n\n```\nimport Button from \"./Button\";\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Button color=\"blue\" size=\"lg\" variant=\"filled\">\n        Click me!\n      </Button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What are the different types of button variants available in this code?\n- There are four types of button variants available: outlined, filled, empty, and link.\n\n2. What are the different types of button colors available in this code?\n- There are eight types of button colors available: blue, pink, gradient, gray, default, red, green, and indigo.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ButtonConfirmed` and `ButtonError` functions?\n- `ButtonConfirmed` and `ButtonError` are functions that return a `Button` component with specific props and styles based on whether the `confirmed` or `error` boolean props are true or false. They are used to render buttons with specific styles for confirmation or error messages.",
