  "summary": "This code defines a styled table component using the styled-components library. The purpose of this code is to create a reusable table component that can be used throughout the larger project. \n\nThe `Table` component is defined as a styled `table` element with various CSS properties applied to it. These properties include setting the font family to Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, collapsing the borders, setting the width to 100%, and hiding any overflow. \n\nThe `td` and `th` elements within the table are also styled with a bottom border and padding of 16px, with additional padding on the left for `td` elements. The `th` elements have a background color of #333333, white text color, and additional padding on the top and bottom. \n\nThis component can be used in various parts of the project where a table is needed. For example, it can be used to display a list of animals in the zoo, their names, and their habitats. \n\nTo use this component, it can be imported into the desired file and used as a regular React component. For example:\n\n```\nimport { Table } from 'zoo';\n\nfunction AnimalList() {\n  return (\n    <Table>\n      <thead>\n        <tr>\n          <th>Name</th>\n          <th>Habitat</th>\n        </tr>\n      </thead>\n      <tbody>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Lion</td>\n          <td>Africa</td>\n        </tr>\n        <tr>\n          <td>Panda</td>\n          <td>Asia</td>\n        </tr>\n      </tbody>\n    </Table>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis would render a table with two columns, \"Name\" and \"Habitat\", and two rows with the animal names and their habitats. Overall, this code provides a simple and reusable way to style tables in the larger project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code defines a styled table component using the styled-components library.\n\n2. What styling is applied to the table and its elements?\n   \n   The table has a width of 100%, uses the Arial font family, and has collapsed borders. The table cells have a bottom border and padding, while the table headers have a top and bottom padding, left padding, left alignment, a background color of #333333, and white text color.\n\n3. Why are the border-radius and border properties commented out?\n   \n   It is unclear why these properties are commented out, but it may be because they are not currently being used or were removed during development.",
