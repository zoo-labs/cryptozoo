  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `AnimalFamily`. This component takes in four props: `image`, `name`, `title`, and `content`. It then returns a JSX element that renders an animal family card with an image, name, and a button to buy an NFT. \n\nThe `Image` component is imported from the `next/image` library and is used to display the animal image. The `Link` component is imported from the `next/link` library and is used to wrap the \"Buy NFT\" button, which links to the `/nft` page. \n\nThe `AnimalInfo` component is imported from the `pages/animal-info` file, which is not shown in this code snippet. It is likely that this component contains additional information about the animal family that is displayed when the user clicks on the animal card. \n\nThis component is likely used in a larger project that involves displaying information about different animal families. It can be used by passing in different props for each animal family, such as the image URL, name, and any additional information. \n\nHere is an example of how this component can be used in another file:\n\n```\nimport AnimalFamily from \"zoo/AnimalFamily\";\n\nconst animalFamilies = [\n  {\n    image: \"lion.jpg\",\n    name: \"Lion Family\",\n    title: \"The King of the Jungle\",\n    content: \"The lion family is known for its strength and courage.\",\n  },\n  {\n    image: \"elephant.jpg\",\n    name: \"Elephant Family\",\n    title: \"The Gentle Giants\",\n    content: \"The elephant family is known for its intelligence and empathy.\",\n  },\n];\n\nconst Zoo = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {animalFamilies.map((family) => (\n        <AnimalFamily\n          image={family.image}\n          name={family.name}\n          title={family.title}\n          content={family.content}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Zoo;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Zoo` component renders multiple `AnimalFamily` components by mapping over an array of animal families. Each `AnimalFamily` component is passed in the relevant props for that animal family. This allows for easy and dynamic rendering of different animal families in the larger project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AnimalFamily` component?\n- The `AnimalFamily` component is used to display information about an animal, including an image, name, and a link to buy an NFT.\n\n2. What libraries or frameworks are being used in this code?\n- The code is using the `next/image` and `next/link` libraries, as well as a custom `AnimalInfo` component located in the `pages` directory.\n\n3. What is the expected output of this code?\n- The expected output of this code is a styled component that displays an animal image, name, and a link to buy an NFT. The `AnimalInfo` component is also included in the output, but its purpose is not clear from this code snippet alone.",
