  "summary": "The `ThemeSwitcher` component is responsible for toggling between light and dark themes in the `zoo` project. It imports the `useTheme` hook from the `next-themes` library, which provides the current theme and a function to set the theme. It also imports two icons from the `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` library, which are used to represent the moon and sun for the dark and light themes respectively. \n\nThe component renders a `Button` component with a conditional class name and style based on the current theme. The class name is set to `text-white` if the theme is dark and `text-black` if the theme is light. The style sets the width and height of the button to 44 pixels and centers its content. \n\nWhen the button is clicked, the `onClick` function is called, which toggles the theme by calling the `setTheme` function with either `'light'` or `'dark'` as an argument. The icon displayed on the button also changes based on the current theme. If the theme is dark, the moon icon is displayed, and if the theme is light, the sun icon is displayed. \n\nThis component can be used in any part of the `zoo` project where a theme switcher is needed. For example, it could be included in a navigation bar or a settings page. Here is an example of how the `ThemeSwitcher` component could be used in a `Header` component:\n\n```\nimport ThemeSwitcher from './ThemeSwitcher'\n\nconst Header = () => {\n  return (\n    <header>\n      <nav>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Home</li>\n          <li>About</li>\n          <li>Contact</li>\n        </ul>\n      </nav>\n      <ThemeSwitcher />\n    </header>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Header\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ThemeSwitcher` component is included in the `Header` component, allowing the user to toggle between light and dark themes from the header of the website.",
  "questions": "1. What library is being used for theming and icon rendering?\n- The code is using `next-themes` library for theming and `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` and `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` for icon rendering.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `ThemeSwitcher` component?\n- The `ThemeSwitcher` component is responsible for rendering a button that toggles between light and dark themes when clicked.\n\n3. How is the button's text color determined based on the current theme?\n- The button's text color is determined by checking if the current theme is `'dark'`. If it is, the text color is set to white, otherwise it is set to black.",
