  "summary": "The `NeonSelect` component is a custom select dropdown component built using React. It takes in two props: `value` and `children`. The `value` prop is the currently selected value of the dropdown, and `children` is an array of `NeonSelectItem` components that represent the options in the dropdown.\n\nThe component uses the `useToggle` hook to manage the state of whether the dropdown is open or closed. It also uses the `useOnClickOutside` hook to detect when the user clicks outside of the dropdown and close it if it is open.\n\nThe `NeonSelect` component renders a div that serves as the container for the entire dropdown. This div has a `ref` attached to it so that the `useOnClickOutside` hook can detect clicks outside of the dropdown. When the user clicks on this div, the `toggle` function is called, which toggles the state of the dropdown between open and closed.\n\nInside the container div, there is another div that represents the currently selected value of the dropdown. This div has a fixed width of 80 pixels and is left-aligned. To the right of this div is a chevron icon that indicates that the dropdown can be expanded. When the user clicks on this icon, the `toggle` function is called, which toggles the state of the dropdown between open and closed.\n\nBelow the container div is another div that represents the dropdown menu. This div is absolutely positioned and has a higher z-index than the container div so that it appears on top of it. The `open` state is used to determine whether this div should be visible or hidden. If the dropdown is open, this div is displayed as a flex column and renders the `children` prop, which is an array of `NeonSelectItem` components.\n\nThe `NeonSelectItem` component represents an option in the dropdown menu. It takes in three props: `onClick`, `value`, and `children`. The `onClick` prop is a function that is called when the user clicks on the option. It takes in two arguments: the click event and the value of the option. The `value` prop is the value of the option, and `children` is the content of the option.\n\nOverall, this component provides a customizable and accessible way to create a select dropdown in a React application. It can be used in a larger project to provide users with a way to select options from a list. Here is an example of how the `NeonSelect` component can be used:\n\n```\n<NeonSelect value=\"Option 1\">\n  <NeonSelectItem value=\"Option 1\">Option 1</NeonSelectItem>\n  <NeonSelectItem value=\"Option 2\">Option 2</NeonSelectItem>\n  <NeonSelectItem value=\"Option 3\">Option 3</NeonSelectItem>\n</NeonSelect>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useOnClickOutside` hook and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `useOnClickOutside` hook is used to detect clicks outside of a specified element and trigger a callback function. In this code, it is used to close the dropdown menu when the user clicks outside of it.\n2. What is the expected type of the `value` prop passed to `NeonSelect`?\n   - The expected type of the `value` prop passed to `NeonSelect` is not specified in the code. It could be any type, but it is likely intended to be a string or number based on its usage in the component.\n3. What is the purpose of the `NeonSelectItem` component and how is it used in conjunction with `NeonSelect`?\n   - The `NeonSelectItem` component is used to define individual items within the dropdown menu of the `NeonSelect` component. It is passed as a child element to `NeonSelect` and is rendered dynamically based on the `children` prop passed to `NeonSelect`. When an item is clicked, the `onClick` function passed to `NeonSelectItem` is triggered with the corresponding `value` prop and index as arguments.",
