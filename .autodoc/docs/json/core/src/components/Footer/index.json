  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `Footer` that renders the footer section of a web page. The footer contains links to various external resources related to the project, as well as a newsletter subscription form. \n\nThe component imports several dependencies, including `Image` and `Link` from the Next.js framework, `useActiveWeb3React` and `useLingui` from custom hooks, and `axios` for making HTTP requests. \n\nThe `Footer` component uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to retrieve the current user's account, chain ID, and library. It also uses the `useLingui` hook to enable internationalization of the text displayed in the footer. \n\nThe component defines a state object called `Form` that contains a single property `email`, which is initially set to an empty string. It also defines two additional state variables, `success` and `error`, which are initially set to `false`. \n\nThe `Footer` component defines two functions, `handleSubmit` and `handleInputChange`, that are used to handle form submissions and input changes, respectively. When the user submits the newsletter subscription form, the `handleSubmit` function sends an HTTP POST request to a server-side API endpoint with the email address entered by the user. If the request is successful, the `Form` state is updated to display a success message, and the `success` state variable is set to `true`. If the request fails, the `Form` state is updated to display an error message, and the `error` state variable is set to `true`. \n\nThe `Footer` component renders a footer section with several links to external resources related to the project, including BSCscan, CoinMarketCap, DEXtools, and CoinGecko. It also renders a newsletter subscription form that allows users to enter their email address and subscribe to the project's newsletter. \n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable component that can be used to render the footer section of a web page in the project. It also demonstrates how to use custom hooks, handle form submissions, and make HTTP requests in a React component.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `handleSubmit` function?\n   \n   The `handleSubmit` function is responsible for sending a POST request to an API endpoint with the email address entered in the form, and updating the state variables `Form`, `error`, and `succes` based on the response from the API.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useActiveWeb3React` hook?\n   \n   The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to retrieve the current active Web3 provider, account, and chain ID from the context of the application. This information is used to determine the current state of the user's connection to the blockchain.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ExternalLink` component?\n   \n   The `ExternalLink` component is used to render an external link with the appropriate styling and behavior, such as opening the link in a new tab and adding an icon to indicate that the link is external. It is used to render links to external resources such as blockchain explorers and bridge interfaces.",
