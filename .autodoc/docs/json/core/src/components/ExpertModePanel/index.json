  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `ExpertModePanel` that renders a panel with a title and a close button. The component takes three props: `active`, a boolean that determines whether the panel is visible or not; `onClose`, a function that is called when the close button is clicked; and `children`, which is used to render the content of the panel.\n\nThe component uses the `useLingui` hook from the `@lingui/react` library to provide internationalization support. The `i18n` object returned by the hook is used to translate the text \"Expert Mode\" using the `t` macro from the `@lingui/macro` library.\n\nIf the `active` prop is `false`, the component simply renders its children. Otherwise, it renders a div with two nested divs: one for the title and close button, and one for the content. The title div has a fixed height and a dark background color, and contains the translated text and a close button that calls the `onClose` function when clicked. The content div has a border and a darker background color, and contains the `children` passed to the component.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to provide a customizable panel that can be shown or hidden based on a boolean value. The `ExpertModePanel` component can be imported and used in other React components like this:\n\n```jsx\nimport ExpertModePanel from './ExpertModePanel';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [expertMode, setExpertMode] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => setExpertMode(true)}>Show expert mode</button>\n      <ExpertModePanel active={expertMode} onClose={() => setExpertMode(false)}>\n        <p>This is the content of the expert mode panel.</p>\n      </ExpertModePanel>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` function defines a state variable `expertMode` that determines whether the `ExpertModePanel` is visible or not. When the \"Show expert mode\" button is clicked, the `expertMode` state is set to `true`, which causes the `ExpertModePanel` to be rendered with its content. When the close button is clicked, the `expertMode` state is set to `false`, which hides the panel.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ExpertModePanel` component?\n   \n   The `ExpertModePanel` component is a React component that renders a panel for expert mode with a title, close button, and content.\n\n2. What is the role of the `useLingui` hook in this code?\n   \n   The `useLingui` hook is used to access the i18n object, which provides internationalization support for the component. It is used to translate the text content of the component.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `FC` type in the component definition?\n   \n   The `FC` type is a shorthand for the `FunctionComponent` type, which is a type of React component that takes props as input and returns JSX as output. It is used to define the type of the `ExpertModePanel` component.",
