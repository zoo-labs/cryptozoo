  "summary": "The `PopupItem` component is a React component that renders a popup notification. It takes in three props: `removeAfterMs`, `content`, and `popKey`. \n\nThe `removeAfterMs` prop is a number that represents the duration in milliseconds after which the popup should be removed. If it is `null`, the popup will not be removed automatically. \n\nThe `content` prop is an object that contains the content of the popup. If the `content` object has a property called `txn`, the component will render a `TransactionPopup` component with the `hash`, `success`, and `summary` properties of the `txn` object. \n\nThe `popKey` prop is a string that represents the unique key of the popup. \n\nThe component uses the `useRemovePopup` hook to get a function that removes the popup from the state. It then uses the `useCallback` hook to memoize the `removeThisPopup` function, which removes the popup with the `popKey` key. \n\nThe component also uses the `useEffect` hook to set a timeout that removes the popup after `removeAfterMs` milliseconds. If `removeAfterMs` is `null`, the effect will not be triggered. \n\nThe component renders a div with a class of `mb-4` that contains a div with a class of `relative w-full overflow-hidden rounded bg-dark-700`. Inside this div, there is another div with a class of `flex flex-row p-4` that contains the `popupContent` and a div with a class of `cursor-pointer hover:text-white` that contains an `XIcon` component. The `XIcon` component is used to close the popup when clicked. \n\nIf `removeAfterMs` is not `null`, the component also renders an `AnimatedFader` component that fades out the popup after `removeAfterMs` milliseconds. \n\nOverall, the `PopupItem` component is a reusable component that can be used to render popup notifications with different content and durations. Here is an example of how it can be used:\n\n```\n<PopupItem\n  removeAfterMs={5000}\n  content={{ txn: { hash: '0x123', success: true, summary: 'Transaction successful' } }}\n  popKey=\"popup1\"\n/>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PopupItem` component?\n- The `PopupItem` component is responsible for rendering a popup with content and an optional timer for automatic removal.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `AnimatedFader` component?\n- The `AnimatedFader` component is a subcomponent of `PopupItem` that renders a gradient bar that animates from left to right over a specified duration.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useRemovePopup` hook?\n- The `useRemovePopup` hook is used to retrieve a function that removes a popup from the application state, which is called when the popup is closed or the timer expires.",
