  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a popup window displaying information about a transaction on a blockchain network. The component takes in three props: `hash`, which is the hash of the transaction, `success`, which is a boolean indicating whether the transaction was successful or not, and `summary`, which is an optional string providing a summary of the transaction.\n\nThe component first imports two icons from the `react-feather` library: `AlertCircle` and `CheckCircle`. These icons are used to display a red or green circle indicating the success or failure of the transaction. It also imports an `ExternalLink` component from a local file, as well as a `getExplorerLink` function and a `useActiveWeb3React` hook from other files in the project.\n\nThe component then renders a div containing two child divs. The first child div contains the success/failure icon, which is conditionally rendered based on the `success` prop. The second child div contains the transaction summary and a link to view the transaction on a blockchain explorer. If the `summary` prop is provided, it is displayed as the summary text. Otherwise, the first eight and last seven characters of the `hash` prop are concatenated to form the summary text.\n\nIf both the `chainId` and `hash` props are provided, the component renders an `ExternalLink` component that displays the text \"View on explorer\" and an external link icon. Clicking on this link opens the transaction details page on a blockchain explorer, using the `getExplorerLink` function to construct the URL based on the `chainId` and `hash` props.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to provide users with a visual indication of the success or failure of their transactions, as well as a convenient link to view the transaction details on a blockchain explorer. It can be easily integrated into other React components by passing in the required props. For example:\n\n```\n<TransactionPopup hash=\"0x123456789abcdef\" success={true} summary=\"Sent 1 ETH to Bob\" />\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and where is it used in the project?\n- This code defines a React component called `TransactionPopup` that displays a transaction summary and a link to view the transaction on an explorer. It is likely used in a part of the project that involves displaying transaction information to the user.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code relies on several external dependencies: `react-feather`, `@heroicons/react`, and `react`. It also imports two functions from other files in the project: `getExplorerLink` and `useActiveWeb3React`.\n\n3. What props does the `TransactionPopup` component accept and how are they used?\n- The `TransactionPopup` component accepts three props: `hash`, `success`, and `summary`. `hash` is a required string that represents the transaction hash to display. `success` is an optional boolean that determines whether to display a green checkmark or a red alert icon. `summary` is an optional string that provides a summary of the transaction, or defaults to displaying the first and last 8 characters of the hash. These props are used to dynamically render the content of the component.",
