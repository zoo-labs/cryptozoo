  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `AnimalFamilyInfo` that displays information about an animal family. The component takes in four props: `name` (a string representing the name of the animal family), `image` (a string representing the filename of the image to display), `descriptionHead` (a string representing the heading of the description), and `description` (a string representing the description of the animal family).\n\nThe component returns a div that contains three child divs. The first child div contains an image of the animal family, which is displayed using the `next/image` component. The second child div contains the name of the animal family, which is displayed as a heading. The third child div contains the description of the animal family, which is displayed as a paragraph of text. The description also includes a link to learn more about the animal family.\n\nThe component uses CSS classes to style the different elements of the component. The image is displayed with a black background and rounded corners, while the name and description are displayed with a white background. The description also has a green link to learn more about the animal family.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that displays information about different animal families. The component can be reused for each animal family, with the `name`, `image`, `descriptionHead`, and `description` props being passed in as needed. For example, the component could be used in a zoo website to display information about different animal families, such as lions, tigers, and bears. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<AnimalFamilyInfo\n  name=\"Lions\"\n  image=\"lion.jpg\"\n  descriptionHead=\"About Lions\"\n  description=\"Lions are large carnivorous mammals that live in Africa and some parts of Asia. They are known for their distinctive manes and powerful roars.\"\n/>\n```",
