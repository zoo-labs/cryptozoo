  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `FiatValue` that takes in two props: `fiatValue` and `priceImpact`. The purpose of this component is to display the fiat value of a given asset and its price impact. \n\nThe `numberWithCommas` function is imported from a separate file called `format.js` and is used to format the fiat value with commas. \n\nThe `useMemo` hook is commented out, but it appears to be used to determine the class name for the `priceImpact` element based on its severity. However, this functionality is not currently being used in the component. \n\nThe component returns a div with a flex layout and right-aligned text. If `fiatValue` is truthy, it displays the fiat value with a dollar sign and commas using the `numberWithCommas` function. If `priceImpact` is truthy, it displays the price impact as a percentage with a negative sign and three significant digits. \n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that involves displaying asset values and their price impacts. It can be easily integrated into other React components and customized with CSS classes. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { FiatValue } from \"zoo\";\n\nfunction AssetInfo({ asset }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>{asset.name}</h2>\n      <p>Current value:</p>\n      <FiatValue fiatValue={asset.fiatValue} priceImpact={asset.priceImpact} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `numberWithCommas` function imported from \"functions/format\"?\n- The `numberWithCommas` function is used to format a number with commas for readability.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `useMemo` hook that is commented out?\n- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of a function so that it is only recomputed when its dependencies change. In this case, it is likely used to compute a class name based on the `priceImpact` prop.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `priceImpact` prop and how is it used in the component?\n- The `priceImpact` prop is used to display the percentage change in price impact. If it is provided, the component will display this value with a sign and a percentage symbol.",
