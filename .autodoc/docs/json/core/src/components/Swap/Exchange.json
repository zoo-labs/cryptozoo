  "summary": "The `ExchangePanel` component is a reusable UI component that provides a user interface for selecting a token and entering a token amount. It is used in the larger project to allow users to exchange tokens on a bridge.\n\nThe component takes in several props, including `value`, `onUserInput`, `onMax`, `showMaxButton`, `label`, `onCurrencySelect`, `token`, `disableCurrencySelect`, `id`, `hideBalance`, `hideInput`, `locked`, `customBalanceText`, `selectedCurrencyBalance`, `fiatValue`, `otherToken`, `onKeyDownFunc`, `onChainChange`, and `chainBalances`. These props are used to customize the behavior and appearance of the component.\n\nThe component renders a button that displays the selected token symbol and logo, and opens a modal when clicked to allow the user to select a different token. It also renders an input field for entering the token amount, and displays the user's token balance and the fiat value of the entered amount. The component also includes a \"Max\" button that sets the input field to the user's maximum token balance.\n\nThe component uses several external libraries, including React, Lottie, and Web3. It also imports several other components and interfaces from the project, including `FiatValue`, `CurrencySearchModal`, `BridgeLogo`, `ChevronDownIcon`, `Balance`, and `Token`.\n\nOverall, the `ExchangePanel` component provides a flexible and customizable UI component for selecting and entering token amounts, and is an important part of the larger project's user interface for exchanging tokens on a bridge.",
