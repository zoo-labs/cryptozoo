  "summary": "The `ExchangeHeader` component is a React functional component that renders a header for a token exchange feature. It receives several props, including `input` and `output`, which are objects representing the input and output tokens for the exchange, respectively. It also receives `allowedSlippage`, a value representing the maximum allowed slippage for the exchange, and `crossChain`, a boolean indicating whether the exchange is cross-chain or not. \n\nThe component renders a container with two sections: one on the left and one on the right. The left section contains a link to the swap page, which is only rendered if either `input` or `output` is not defined. If both `input` and `output` are defined, the left section displays either \"Cross-Chain\" or \"Instant Trade\" depending on the value of `crossChain`. The right section contains three icons: a refresh icon, a filter icon, and a settings icon. Clicking on the refresh icon calls the `fetchUserBalances` function, which retrieves the user's token balances. Clicking on the filter icon opens a modal that allows the user to adjust the slippage tolerance for the exchange. Clicking on the settings icon opens a settings modal that is not implemented in this code.\n\nThe `SlippageModal` component is a child component of `ExchangeHeader` that renders the modal for adjusting the slippage tolerance. It receives three props: `autoRefresh`, a boolean indicating whether auto-refresh is enabled or not, `autoRefreshHandler`, a function that toggles the value of `autoRefresh`, and `isSlipToleranceModal`, a boolean indicating whether the modal is open or not. The modal contains several input fields and switches that allow the user to adjust various settings related to the exchange.\n\nThis component can be used as a header for a token exchange feature in a larger project. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to initiate and customize token exchanges. The `ExchangeHeader` component can be easily integrated into other components and pages in the project, and the `SlippageModal` component can be reused in other parts of the project that require a modal for adjusting settings. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport ExchangeHeader from \"components/ExchangeHeader\";\n\nfunction ExchangePage() {\n  const inputToken = { address: \"0x123abc\", symbol: \"ETH\" };\n  const outputToken = { address: \"0x456def\", symbol: \"USDT\" };\n  const allowedSlippage = 0.5;\n  const crossChain = true;\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ExchangeHeader\n        input={inputToken}\n        output={outputToken}\n        allowedSlippage={allowedSlippage}\n        crossChain={crossChain}\n      />\n      {/* rest of the exchange page */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ExchangeHeader` component?\n- The `ExchangeHeader` component is used to display the header section of a page related to exchanging tokens, and it takes in various props related to the exchange.\n\n2. What is the `SlippageModal` component used for?\n- The `SlippageModal` component is used to display a modal that allows the user to adjust the slippage tolerance and other settings related to the token exchange.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `getQuery` function?\n- The `getQuery` function takes in two parameters, `input` and `output`, and returns an object that contains the addresses of the input and output currencies if they are provided. If only the input currency is provided, the output currency is set to \"ETH\". If neither input nor output currencies are provided, the function returns null.",
