  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `CustomizedSteppers` that renders a customized stepper component. The stepper component is used to display a sequence of steps that a user can take to complete a process. Each step is represented by a label and an icon. The stepper also includes a connector that visually connects the steps.\n\nThe `CustomizedSteppers` component takes two props: `steps` and `activeStep`. `steps` is an array of objects that define the steps. Each object has a `label`, an `icon`, and a `logo`. `label` is a string that represents the label for the step. `icon` is a number that represents the index of the icon for the step. `logo` is a string that represents the URL of the logo for the step. `activeStep` is a number that represents the index of the active step.\n\nThe `CustomizedSteppers` component renders a `Stack` component that contains a `Stepper` component. The `Stepper` component renders a `Step` component for each step in the `steps` array. The `Step` component contains a `StepLabel` component that displays the label and icon for the step. The `StepLabel` component also contains an optional `sublabel` that displays additional information about the step.\n\nThe `StepIconComponent` prop of the `StepLabel` component is set to a custom `ColorlibStepIcon` component. The `ColorlibStepIcon` component renders the icon for the step. The `ColorlibStepIcon` component also includes an animation that is displayed when the step is active.\n\nThe `Stepper` component includes a `ColorlibConnector` component that renders the connector between the steps. The `ColorlibConnector` component includes styles that customize the appearance of the connector.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable component that can be used to display a sequence of steps in a process. The component is highly customizable and can be used in a variety of contexts. For example, it could be used in a multi-step form or a checkout process.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `CustomizedSteppers` component?\n- The `CustomizedSteppers` component is used to render a stepper with custom styling and icons based on the `steps` prop passed to it.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `ColorlibConnector` and `ColorlibStepIcon` components?\n- The `ColorlibConnector` component is a styled component that customizes the appearance of the connector between steps in the stepper. The `ColorlibStepIcon` component is a custom icon component that renders an image and animation based on the `steps` prop passed to it.\n\n3. What external libraries are being used in this file?\n- This file is using several external libraries: `React`, `@mui/material`, `@mui/material/styles`, and `next/image`.",
