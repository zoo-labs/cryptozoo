  "summary": "The `ZooItem` component is a React component that renders a single item in the Zoo marketplace. It takes in four props: `src`, `infoTitle`, `infoDesc`, and `authenticityPrice`. \n\nThe component is divided into two main sections: the first section displays an image of the item, along with a \"Make Offer\" button, while the second section displays information about the item, including its title, description, and details such as the transaction hash, token ID, and token standard. The second section also includes a \"Proof of Authenticity\" section, which displays the price of the item's authenticity proof, a link to the transaction on Etherscan, and a link to view the item on IPS.\n\nThe component uses several third-party libraries, including Next.js, which provides server-side rendering and other features for React applications, and the `Image` component from Next.js, which optimizes images for performance. The component also uses the `Link` component from Next.js to create links to other pages in the application.\n\nThe component is designed to be reusable, allowing it to be used to display any item in the Zoo marketplace. For example, the component could be used to display a painting, a sculpture, or a rare collectible. The component's props allow it to be customized for each item, with the `src` prop specifying the image source, the `infoTitle` prop specifying the item's title, the `infoDesc` prop specifying the item's description, and the `authenticityPrice` prop specifying the price of the item's authenticity proof.\n\nHere is an example of how the `ZooItem` component could be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport ZooItem from './ZooItem';\n\nconst items = [\n  {\n    src: '/painting.jpg',\n    infoTitle: 'Mona Lisa',\n    infoDesc: 'A painting by Leonardo da Vinci',\n    authenticityPrice: '0.1 ETH',\n  },\n  {\n    src: '/sculpture.jpg',\n    infoTitle: 'David',\n    infoDesc: 'A sculpture by Michelangelo',\n    authenticityPrice: '0.2 ETH',\n  },\n];\n\nfunction Marketplace() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {items.map((item) => (\n        <ZooItem\n          src={item.src}\n          infoTitle={item.infoTitle}\n          infoDesc={item.infoDesc}\n          authenticityPrice={item.authenticityPrice}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Marketplace` component renders a list of items using the `ZooItem` component. The `items` array contains two objects, each representing an item in the marketplace. The `ZooItem` component is used to render each item, with the `src`, `infoTitle`, `infoDesc`, and `authenticityPrice` props set to the corresponding values for each item.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ZooItem` component?\n- The `ZooItem` component is a Next.js page component that renders a single item in the zoo.\n\n2. What props does the `ZooItem` component expect?\n- The `ZooItem` component expects four props: `src` (a string representing the image source), `infoTitle` (a string representing the title of the item), `infoDesc` (a string representing the description of the item), and `authenticityPrice` (a string representing the price of the item).\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Link` component from Next.js?\n- The `Link` component from Next.js is used to create client-side navigation between pages in a Next.js app. In this code, it is used to create a link to the Etherscan transaction and to the IPS view of the item.",
