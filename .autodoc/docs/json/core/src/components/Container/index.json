  "summary": "The code above is a React component that exports a container with a maximum width. The component is part of a larger project called \"zoo\". \n\nThe `MAX_WIDTH` object contains CSS classes that define the maximum width of the container. The keys of the object represent the different sizes of the container, and the values are the corresponding CSS classes. The sizes range from \"full\" to \"xs\", with \"2xl\" being the default size.\n\nThe `Container` component takes three props: `children`, `maxWidth`, and `className`. The `children` prop is used to render any child components within the container. The `maxWidth` prop is used to set the maximum width of the container. If no `maxWidth` prop is provided, the default value of \"2xl\" is used. The `className` prop is used to add any additional CSS classes to the container.\n\nThe `classNames` function is imported from a file located in the `functions` directory. This function is used to concatenate the CSS classes passed in as props with the CSS classes defined in the `MAX_WIDTH` object.\n\nThe `Container` component returns a `div` element with the concatenated CSS classes and any additional props passed in using the spread operator. The `children` prop is rendered within the `div` element.\n\nThis component can be used throughout the larger \"zoo\" project to create containers with a maximum width. Developers can customize the maximum width of the container by passing in a `maxWidth` prop, or they can use the default value of \"2xl\". They can also add any additional CSS classes to the container using the `className` prop. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport Container from \"./path/to/Container\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Container maxWidth=\"lg\" className=\"my-container\">\n      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>\n    </Container>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn the example above, a `Container` component is imported and used to create a container with a maximum width of \"lg\" and an additional CSS class of \"my-container\". The `h1` element is rendered within the container.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `classNames` function imported from \"../../functions\"?\n- A smart developer might ask what the `classNames` function does and how it is used in this code. The `classNames` function is likely used to concatenate multiple class names together and return a single string that can be used as a value for the `className` prop.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `MAX_WIDTH` object?\n- A smart developer might ask why the `MAX_WIDTH` object is defined and how it is used in this code. The `MAX_WIDTH` object maps different string values to CSS class names that set the maximum width of the container. This object is used to dynamically set the `className` prop of the `div` element based on the `maxWidth` prop passed to the `Container` component.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Container` component?\n- A smart developer might ask what the `Container` component does and how it is used in this code. The `Container` component is a reusable component that renders a `div` element with a maximum width based on the `maxWidth` prop passed to it. It also accepts a `className` prop and any additional props that can be spread onto the `div` element.",
