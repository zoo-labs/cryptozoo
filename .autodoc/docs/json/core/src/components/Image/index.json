  "summary": "This code exports a React component called `Image` that wraps the `NextImage` component from the `next/image` package. The `Image` component is used to display images in the application. It accepts several props, including `src`, `width`, `height`, `layout`, `loader`, and `style`. \n\nThe `Image` component uses a `useBlur` flag to determine whether to display a blurred placeholder image while the actual image is loading. If the `height` and `width` props are both greater than or equal to 40, the blurred placeholder image is displayed. Otherwise, an empty placeholder is used. \n\nThe `loader` prop is used to specify the image loader function. By default, the `cloudinaryLoader` function from the `cloudinary` module is used. However, the `loader` prop can be used to override this default and provide a custom image loader function. \n\nThe `cloudinaryLoader` function is not defined in this file, but it is imported from the `cloudinary` module. This function is used to generate a URL for the image using the Cloudinary image service. \n\nThe `normalize` function is used to remove the leading slash from the `src` prop, if it exists. This is necessary because the Cloudflare loader function expects the `src` prop to be a relative path without a leading slash. \n\nThe `cloudFlareLoader` function is used to generate a URL for the image using the Cloudflare image service. This function takes the `src`, `width`, and `quality` props as arguments and returns a URL that includes these parameters. \n\nThe `shimmer` function generates an SVG placeholder image with a shimmer effect. This function takes the `width` and `height` props as arguments and returns an SVG string. \n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and customizable way to display images in the application. The `Image` component can be used with different image loaders and can display a blurred placeholder image while the actual image is loading.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `cloudinaryLoader` function imported from `../../functions/cloudinary`?\n- This code does not provide information on the purpose of the `cloudinaryLoader` function. \n\n2. What is the purpose of the `normalize` function?\n- The `normalize` function is used to remove the leading slash from the `src` parameter if it exists.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `shimmer` function?\n- The `shimmer` function returns an SVG string that is used as a placeholder image while the actual image is being loaded. The SVG string is animated to create a shimmer effect.",
