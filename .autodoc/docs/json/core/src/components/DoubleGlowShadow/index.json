  "summary": "The `DoubleGlowShadow` component is a React functional component that conditionally renders a double glow shadow effect around its children. The component imports the `isMobile` function from the `react-device-detect` library and the `FC` type from the `react` library. It also imports the `classNames` function from a `functions` module located in a parent directory.\n\nThe `DoubleGlowShadow` component takes in two props: `className` and `children`. The `className` prop is optional and is used to add additional CSS classes to the component. The `children` prop is also optional and represents the children components that will be wrapped by the `DoubleGlowShadow` component.\n\nThe component first checks if the `isMobile` function returns `true`. If it does, the component returns a div with a class of `shadow-swap` that wraps the `children` prop. This div does not have any shadow effects.\n\nIf the `isMobile` function returns `false`, the component returns a div that has three child divs. The first and second child divs are positioned absolutely and have a background color of blue and pink respectively. They are positioned on opposite sides of the parent div and have a width of 3/5 of the parent div's width. They also have a rounded border and a z-index of 0. These two divs create the double glow effect.\n\nThe third child div is positioned relatively and has a CSS filter of `drop-shadow`. This creates a shadow effect around the `children` prop. The `children` prop is wrapped by this div.\n\nThe `DoubleGlowShadow` component can be used in a larger project to add a double glow shadow effect around components. It can be used to highlight important components or to add a visual effect to a page. Here is an example of how the component can be used:\n\n```\nimport DoubleGlowShadow from \"./components/DoubleGlowShadow\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <DoubleGlowShadow>\n        <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      </DoubleGlowShadow>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `react-device-detect` library being imported?\n- The `react-device-detect` library is being used to check if the user is on a mobile device or not.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `DoubleGlowShadow` component?\n- The `DoubleGlowShadow` component is used to add a double glow shadow effect to its child components. If the user is on a mobile device, it will display a different shadow effect.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `classNames` function being imported from \"../../functions\"?\n- The `classNames` function is being used to concatenate multiple class names together for the `className` prop of the `div` element being returned by the `DoubleGlowShadow` component.",
