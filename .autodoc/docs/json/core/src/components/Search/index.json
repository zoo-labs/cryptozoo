  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called `Search` that renders a search input field with a search icon. The component takes in several props, including `term`, `search`, `className`, and `inputProps`. \n\nThe `term` prop is a string that represents the current search term entered by the user. The `search` prop is a function that is called whenever the user types in the search input field. The `className` prop is an optional string that represents the CSS class name(s) to apply to the component. The `inputProps` prop is an optional object that contains additional props to apply to the input field.\n\nThe component renders a `div` element with a `relative` position and a `rounded` class. The `className` prop is applied to this `div` element. Inside the `div`, there is an `input` element that has several CSS classes applied to it. The `input` element has an `onChange` event listener that calls the `search` function with the current value of the input field whenever the user types in the field. The `value` prop of the `input` element is set to the `term` prop, which represents the current search term entered by the user. The `placeholder` prop of the `input` element is set to a string that prompts the user to enter a search term.\n\nFinally, there is a `div` element with an `absolute` position that contains a search icon. The search icon is imported from the `react-feather` library and is rendered using the `Search` component. The `size` prop of the `SearchIcon` component is set to `16`.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to render a search input field with a search icon. The `term` and `search` props can be used to manage the state of the search input field and perform a search operation respectively. The `className` and `inputProps` props can be used to customize the appearance and behavior of the search input field. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<Search term={searchTerm} search={handleSearch} className=\"my-search\" inputProps={{ maxLength: 50 }} />\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this component and how is it used in the project?\n- This component is a search bar that takes in a search term and a search function as props, and can be styled using the `className` prop. It is likely used to allow users to search for specific items within the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the `classNames` function being imported from `../../functions` and how is it used in this component?\n- The `classNames` function is likely a utility function for generating CSS class names based on the props passed to a component. In this component, it is used to concatenate the `className` prop passed to the component with the default `rounded` class.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `inputProps` prop and how is it used in this component?\n- The `inputProps` prop is an object that can contain additional props to be passed to the `input` element rendered by this component. It defaults to an object containing a `className` prop that sets the styles for the input element. Any additional props passed to `inputProps` will be spread onto the `input` element.",
