  "summary": "The `CurrencySelectPanel` component is a React component that renders a panel for selecting a currency. It takes in several props, including an `onClick` function, an `onCurrencySelect` function, a `currency` object, a boolean `disableCurrencySelect`, an `otherCurrency` object, an `id` string, and a boolean `showCommonBases`. \n\nWhen the component is rendered, it displays a panel with a currency logo, a currency symbol, and a chevron icon. If a `currency` object is provided, the logo and symbol are displayed for that currency. If not, a placeholder animation is displayed. If the `disableCurrencySelect` prop is set to true, the chevron icon is not displayed and the `onClick` function is not called when the panel is clicked. Otherwise, when the panel is clicked, a modal is opened that allows the user to search for and select a currency. \n\nWhen a currency is selected in the modal, the `onCurrencySelect` function is called with the selected currency object as an argument. The `otherCurrency` prop can be used to pass in a second currency object to be displayed in the modal. The `showCommonBases` prop determines whether or not to display a list of common currency bases in the modal.\n\nThis component is likely used in a larger project that involves selecting currencies for some sort of financial transaction or exchange. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting a currency and can be easily customized with different logos and symbols for different currencies. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<CurrencySelectPanel\n  onClick={() => console.log(\"Panel clicked!\")}\n  onCurrencySelect={(currency) => console.log(`Selected currency: ${currency.symbol}`)}\n  currency={{ symbol: \"ETH\" }}\n  disableCurrencySelect={false}\n  otherCurrency={{ symbol: \"USDC\" }}\n  id=\"currency-select-panel\"\n  showCommonBases={true}\n/>\n```",
