  "summary": "The code above is a function that exports a notification system using the `react-toastify` library. The purpose of this code is to provide a simple and customizable way to display notifications to the user. \n\nThe `notify` function takes two parameters: `message` and `type`. The `message` parameter is a string that represents the message to be displayed in the notification. The `type` parameter is also a string that represents the type of notification to be displayed. The `type` parameter can be one of three values: \"error\", \"success\", or any other value, which will display an \"info\" notification.\n\nThe function uses a switch statement to determine which type of notification to display based on the `type` parameter. If the `type` parameter is \"error\", the function will display an error notification using the `toast.error` method from the `react-toastify` library. If the `type` parameter is \"success\", the function will display a success notification using the `toast.success` method. If the `type` parameter is any other value, the function will display an info notification using the `toast.info` method.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to provide a consistent and user-friendly way to display notifications to the user. For example, if there is an error in the application, the `notify` function can be called with the \"error\" type and an appropriate error message to alert the user. Similarly, if a task is completed successfully, the `notify` function can be called with the \"success\" type and a success message to inform the user. \n\nHere is an example of how the `notify` function can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { notify } from \"./notify\";\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const handleClick = () => {\n    // do some task\n    notify(\"Task completed successfully!\", \"success\");\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={handleClick}>Do Task</button>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `notify` function is imported from the `notify` file and used to display a success notification when the button is clicked and the task is completed successfully.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `react-toastify` library and how is it being used in this code?\n   - The `react-toastify` library is being used to display toast notifications. It is imported and used to display different types of notifications based on the `type` parameter passed to the `notify` function.\n2. What are the possible values for the `type` parameter in the `notify` function?\n   - The possible values for the `type` parameter are \"error\", \"success\", and any other value which will result in an \"info\" notification being displayed.\n3. Are there any other functions or components in this file that are not being exported?\n   - No, there are no other functions or components in this file that are not being exported. The `notify` function is the only export from this file.",
