  "summary": "This code exports a set of functions and actions that can be used in the larger project. The functions and actions are related to the zoo project and are used to manage the state of the application. The code imports various types and interfaces from other files in the project. \n\nThe `createAction` function is used to create actions that can be dispatched to the store. The actions include `getZooBalance`, `getBNBBalance`, `getEggs`, `getAllowance`, `addEgg`, `loading`, `updateMyNfts`, `eggsCount`, `animalsCount`, `breedsCount`, `addAuctionNft`, `createBid`, and `addNftTTransfers`. \n\nThe `getZooBalance` action is used to get the balance of the zoo token for a given account. The `getBNBBalance` action is used to get the balance of BNB for a given account. The `getEggs` action is used to get the eggs for a given account. The `getAllowance` action is used to get the allowance for a given account. The `addEgg` action is used to add an egg to the state. The `loading` action is used to set the loading state of the application. The `updateMyNfts` action is used to update the NFTs for a given account. The `eggsCount` action is used to update the count of eggs. The `animalsCount` action is used to update the count of animals. The `breedsCount` action is used to update the count of breeds. The `addAuctionNft` action is used to add an NFT to the auction. The `createBid` action is used to create a bid for an NFT. The `addNftTTransfers` action is used to add an NFT transfer to the state.\n\nThe code also exports the `clear`, `push`, and `remove` functions from the `toasts` file. These functions are used to manage the toasts in the application.\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of functions and actions that can be used to manage the state of the zoo project. These functions and actions can be imported and used in other files in the project.",
