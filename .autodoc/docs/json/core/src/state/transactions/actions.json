  "summary": "This code defines a set of actions and interfaces related to transactions in the Zoo project. The `import` statements at the top of the file bring in the `ChainId` type from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library and the `createAction` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library.\n\nThe `SerializableTransactionReceipt` interface defines the shape of a transaction receipt object that can be serialized and stored in the project's state. It includes properties such as the `to` and `from` addresses, the `transactionHash`, and the `blockNumber`.\n\nThe file then exports four different actions using the `createAction` function. Each action corresponds to a different type of transaction-related event that can occur in the project. \n\nThe `addTransaction` action is used to add a new transaction to the project's state. It takes an object as its payload that includes the `chainId`, `hash`, `from` address, and optional `approval`, `claim`, `summary`, and `archer` properties. These properties provide additional context about the transaction, such as the token being approved or the recipient of a claim.\n\nThe `clearAllTransactions` action is used to clear all transactions from the project's state for a given `chainId`.\n\nThe `finalizeTransaction` action is used to update the project's state with the final details of a transaction, such as the `receipt` object that includes information about the transaction's execution.\n\nThe `checkedTransaction` action is used to update the project's state with the latest block number for a given transaction.\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of actions and interfaces that can be used to manage transactions in the Zoo project. These actions can be dispatched from other parts of the project to update the state and trigger side effects, such as displaying transaction details to the user or triggering additional actions based on the outcome of a transaction. Here is an example of how the `addTransaction` action might be used:\n\n```\nimport { addTransaction } from 'zoo/transactions'\n\nconst transaction = {\n  chainId: 1,\n  hash: '0x123abc',\n  from: '0x456def',\n  approval: { tokenAddress: '0x789ghi', spender: '0xabcjkl' },\n  summary: 'Approved tokens for spending'\n}\n\ndispatch(addTransaction(transaction))\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `addTransaction` function?\n   - The `addTransaction` function is a Redux action creator that adds a new transaction to the state with various properties such as chainId, hash, from, approval, claim, summary, and archer.\n\n2. What is the `SerializableTransactionReceipt` interface used for?\n   - The `SerializableTransactionReceipt` interface defines the structure of a transaction receipt object that contains information such as the sender, recipient, contract address, transaction hash, block number, and status.\n\n3. What is the `checkedTransaction` function used for?\n   - The `checkedTransaction` function is a Redux action creator that updates the block number of a transaction with the given hash on the specified chain.",
