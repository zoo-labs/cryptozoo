  "summary": "The code in this file is part of the larger zoo project and contains functions that allow users to claim SUSHI tokens from a Merkle distributor contract. The code imports various libraries and hooks from the project, including `@zoolabs/zdk`, `@ethersproject/address`, `react`, and others. \n\nThe `fetchClaim` function takes an Ethereum address and a chain ID as input and returns a promise that resolves to the user's claim data or null if the address is invalid. The function fetches the Merkle root from a constant file and uses it to retrieve the claim data from the distributor contract. The claim data includes the user's index, amount, and proof. The function caches the promise for each address and chain ID combination to avoid redundant requests.\n\nThe `useUserClaimData` hook takes an Ethereum address as input and returns the user's claim data or null if the data is not available. The hook uses the `fetchClaim` function to fetch the claim data and stores it in state. The hook updates the state whenever the address or chain ID changes.\n\nThe `useUserHasAvailableClaim` hook takes an Ethereum address as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the user has an available claim. The hook uses the `useUserClaimData` hook to retrieve the user's claim data and the `useMerkleDistributorContract` hook to retrieve the distributor contract. The hook uses the `useSingleCallResult` hook to check whether the user has claimed their tokens.\n\nThe `useUserUnclaimedAmount` hook takes an Ethereum address as input and returns the user's unclaimed SUSHI tokens. The hook uses the `useUserClaimData` and `useUserHasAvailableClaim` hooks to retrieve the user's claim data and check whether the user has an available claim. The hook uses the `SUSHI` token from the project's configuration file to calculate the amount of unclaimed tokens.\n\nThe `useClaimCallback` hook takes an Ethereum address as input and returns a function that allows the user to claim their SUSHI tokens. The hook uses the `useActiveWeb3React`, `useUserClaimData`, `useUserUnclaimedAmount`, `useTransactionAdder`, and `useMerkleDistributorContract` hooks to retrieve the user's claim data, unclaimed tokens, and the distributor contract. The hook estimates the gas limit for the claim transaction and adds the transaction to the project's transaction list.\n\nOverall, this file contains functions and hooks that allow users to claim SUSHI tokens from a Merkle distributor contract. These functions and hooks are used in other parts of the project to provide users with information about their claims and allow them to claim their tokens.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `fetchClaim` function?\n- The `fetchClaim` function fetches the claim data for a given address and chain ID from a merkle root and returns it as a promise.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useUserHasAvailableClaim` function?\n- The `useUserHasAvailableClaim` function checks if a user is in the merkle root blob and has not yet claimed UNI.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useClaimCallback` function?\n- The `useClaimCallback` function returns a callback function that can be used to claim SUSHI for a user with unclaimed rewards.",
