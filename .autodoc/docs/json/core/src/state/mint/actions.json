  "summary": "This code is a module that exports two functions: `typeInput` and `resetMintState`. It also exports an enum called `Field` that defines two constants: `CURRENCY_A` and `CURRENCY_B`. \n\nThe `typeInput` function is created using the `createAction` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library. It takes in an object with three properties: `field`, `typedValue`, and `noLiquidity`. The `field` property is of type `Field`, which is the enum defined in this module. The `typedValue` property is of type `string` and represents the user's input. The `noLiquidity` property is of type `boolean` and is used to indicate whether there is enough liquidity to perform the requested action. \n\nThe purpose of the `typeInput` function is to create an action that can be dispatched to the Redux store. This action represents the user's input when they are trying to mint a new currency. The `field` property indicates which currency the user is trying to mint, and the `typedValue` property represents the amount they want to mint. The `noLiquidity` property is used to indicate whether there is enough liquidity to perform the requested action. \n\nThe `resetMintState` function is also created using the `createAction` function. It takes no arguments and is used to reset the state of the minting process. \n\nIn the larger project, these functions would be used to update the state of the Redux store when the user interacts with the minting feature. For example, when the user types in a value to mint, the `typeInput` function would be called with the appropriate arguments, and an action would be dispatched to the Redux store. This action would then be handled by a reducer, which would update the state of the store accordingly. The `resetMintState` function would be used to reset the state of the store when the user cancels the minting process or when it is completed. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { typeInput, resetMintState, Field } from 'zoo'\n\n// Dispatch an action to update the state of the store with the user's input\ndispatch(typeInput({ field: Field.CURRENCY_A, typedValue: '100', noLiquidity: false }))\n\n// Reset the state of the store\ndispatch(resetMintState())\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `createAction` function from `@reduxjs/toolkit` being imported?\n- The `createAction` function is used to create two Redux actions: `typeInput` and `resetMintState`.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Field` enum?\n- The `Field` enum is used to define two currency fields: `CURRENCY_A` and `CURRENCY_B`.\n\n3. What parameters are expected for the `typeInput` action?\n- The `typeInput` action expects an object with three properties: `field` (a value from the `Field` enum), `typedValue` (a string), and `noLiquidity` (a boolean).",
