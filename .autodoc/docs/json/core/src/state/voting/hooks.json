  "summary": "The code is a module that exports three React hooks: `useCreateProposals`, `useHandleVoteProposal`, and `useGetVotingAmount`. These hooks are used to create, vote on, and retrieve voting amounts for proposals respectively. \n\nThe `useCreateProposals` hook is used to create a new proposal. It takes in a `Proposal` object, a callback function, and a success callback function. The `Proposal` object contains the details of the proposal such as the title, description, start and end dates, and choices. The hook then validates the input data and signs the proposal using the user's account and library. It then sends the signed proposal to the IPFS network using the `pinJSONToIPFS` function. If the proposal is successfully added to IPFS, it is then added to the state using the `addProposal` function. \n\nThe `useHandleVoteProposal` hook is used to vote on a proposal. It takes in a `Proposal` object, a vote choice, and an optional success callback function. The hook validates the user's account and vote choice, and then checks if the user has already voted on the proposal. If the user has not voted, it checks if the user has approved the contract to spend their tokens using the `useVotingApproveCallback` hook. If the user has not approved the contract, it prompts the user to approve it. Finally, it calls the `voteProposal` function to submit the vote to the contract.\n\nThe `useGetVotingAmount` hook is used to retrieve the number of approved and disapproved votes for a proposal. It takes in the user's address and the proposal ID, and then calls the `votingAmount` function on the contract to retrieve the voting amounts. It then returns an object containing the number of approved and disapproved votes.\n\nOverall, these hooks are used to manage the creation and voting on proposals in the larger project. They provide an easy-to-use interface for interacting with the contract and IPFS network. Below is an example of how the `useCreateProposals` hook can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { useCreateProposals } from 'zoo';\n\nfunction CreateProposalForm() {\n  const createProposal = useCreateProposals();\n\n  const handleSubmit = (data) => {\n    createProposal(data, () => {\n      console.log('Creating proposal...');\n    }, () => {\n      console.log('Proposal created successfully!');\n    });\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>\n      {/* form fields */}\n    </form>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useCreateProposals` function?\n- The `useCreateProposals` function is used to create a new proposal by sending a JSON payload to IPFS and adding the proposal to the state using the `addProposal` hook.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `pinJSONToIPFS` function?\n- The `pinJSONToIPFS` function is used to send a JSON payload to the Pinata API and return the IPFS hash of the pinned content.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useHandleVoteProposal` function?\n- The `useHandleVoteProposal` function is used to handle the voting process for a proposal by calling the `voteProposal` hook and passing in the proposal IPFS hash and the user's vote choice. It also handles the approval process by calling the `approve` function if the user has not yet approved the contract.",
