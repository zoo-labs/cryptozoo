  "summary": "The code is a React hook that provides a strategy for staking SUSHI tokens to Aave. The hook is called `useStakeSushiToAaveStrategy` and it returns a `StrategyHook` object. The `StrategyHook` object contains a set of functions and data that can be used to interact with the strategy.\n\nThe `useStakeSushiToAaveStrategy` hook uses other hooks and functions to implement the strategy. It uses the `useBaseStrategy` hook to get the base strategy object, which contains the common functions and data for all strategies. It also uses the `useTokenBalances` hook to get the SUSHI and AXSUSHI token balances for the current user's account.\n\nThe `GENERAL` function returns an object that contains general information about the strategy, such as the name, steps, zap method, and description. The `tokenDefinitions` object contains the input and output token definitions for the strategy.\n\nThe `useEffect` hook is used to update the token balances when they change. The `setBalances` function is used to set the input and output token balances for the strategy.\n\nThe `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the `GENERAL` function and the `StrategyHook` object. This improves performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable strategy for staking SUSHI tokens to Aave. It can be used in other parts of the project to provide a seamless user experience for staking SUSHI tokens. For example, it could be used in a staking pool UI to allow users to stake their SUSHI tokens with a single click.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a strategy for staking SUSHI tokens and depositing them into Aave in one click, using xSUSHI in Aave (aXSUSHI) as collateral for borrowing or lending.\n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n   - This code depends on several external packages and modules, including `@zoolabs/zdk`, `@lingui/core`, `@lingui/macro`, `@lingui/react`, `react`, and various custom hooks and types defined in other files within the `zoo` project.\n3. What is the expected output of this code?\n   - The expected output of this code is a custom React hook called `useStakeSushiToAaveStrategy`, which returns an object containing various properties and methods related to the SUSHI â†’ Aave staking strategy, including the `setBalances` method and the `general` and `tokenDefinitions` objects.",
