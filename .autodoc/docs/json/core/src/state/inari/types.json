  "summary": "This code defines various interfaces and types related to the Inari project's strategies for swapping tokens. The `import` statements bring in necessary dependencies from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library and other files in the project. \n\nThe `Strategy` interface defines the structure of a strategy object, which includes an ID, general information about the strategy, and definitions of the input and output tokens. The `StrategyGeneralInfo` interface provides more specific information about the strategy, such as its name, description, and symbols for the input and output tokens. The `StrategyToken` interface defines the properties of a token, including its chain ID, address, decimals, and symbol. \n\nThe `StrategyBalances` interface defines the structure of an object that holds the balances of the input and output tokens for a given strategy. \n\nThe `StrategyHook` type is a union of three other types, each of which represents a different hook that can be used in a strategy. These hooks provide additional functionality for interacting with the BentoBox and permit tokens. \n\nThe `InariState` interface defines the structure of the state object for the Inari project, which includes information about the current strategy, whether the user is zapping in or out, and the input and output values. The `DerivedInariState` interface extends `InariState` and adds derived properties for the input and output token amounts and token objects. \n\nOverall, this code provides a foundation for defining and managing the state and functionality of the Inari project's token swapping strategies. It can be used in conjunction with other files and modules in the project to implement the actual swapping logic and user interface. \n\nExample usage:\n```typescript\nconst strategy: Strategy = {\n  id: 'my-strategy',\n  general: {\n    name: 'My Strategy',\n    steps: ['Step 1', 'Step 2'],\n    zapMethod: 'zap',\n    unzapMethod: 'unzap',\n    description: 'A custom strategy for swapping tokens',\n    inputSymbol: 'ETH',\n    outputSymbol: 'USDC'\n  },\n  tokenDefinitions: {\n    inputToken: {\n      chainId: ChainId.MAINNET,\n      address: '0x123abc',\n      decimals: 18,\n      symbol: 'ETH'\n    },\n    outputToken: {\n      chainId: ChainId.MAINNET,\n      address: '0x456def',\n      decimals: 6,\n      symbol: 'USDC'\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst balances: StrategyBalances = {\n  inputTokenBalance: CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(strategy.tokenDefinitions.inputToken, '1'),\n  outputTokenBalance: CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(strategy.tokenDefinitions.outputToken, '100')\n}\n\nconst inariState: InariState = {\n  id: 'my-state',\n  zapIn: true,\n  inputValue: '0.5',\n  outputValue: '50',\n  general: strategy.general,\n  tokens: strategy.tokenDefinitions\n}\n\nconst derivedState: DerivedInariState = {\n  ...inariState,\n  inputValue: CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(strategy.tokenDefinitions.inputToken, inariState.inputValue),\n  outputValue: CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(strategy.tokenDefinitions.outputToken, inariState.outputValue),\n  tokens: {\n    inputToken: new Token(strategy.tokenDefinitions.inputToken.chainId, strategy.tokenDefinitions.inputToken.address, strategy.tokenDefinitions.inputToken.decimals, strategy.tokenDefinitions.inputToken.symbol),\n    outputToken: new Token(strategy.tokenDefinitions.outputToken.chainId, strategy.tokenDefinitions.outputToken.address, strategy.tokenDefinitions.outputToken.decimals, strategy.tokenDefinitions.outputToken.symbol)\n  }\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code defines interfaces and types related to a strategy for swapping tokens, as well as state interfaces for an Inari app. It likely solves the problem of providing a standardized way to define and interact with token swapping strategies.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code and where can they be found?\n- This code imports several dependencies from the `@zoolabs/zdk` package, as well as several other modules within the `zoo` project. The specific locations of these dependencies would need to be determined by examining the project's file structure.\n\n3. What is the difference between `Strategy` and `DerivedInariState`?\n- `Strategy` defines the structure of a token swapping strategy, including general information about the strategy and definitions of the input and output tokens. `DerivedInariState` extends `InariState` and adds additional derived properties, including `inputValue` and `outputValue` as `CurrencyAmount<Token>` types and `inputToken` and `outputToken` as `Token` types.",
