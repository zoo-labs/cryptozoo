  "summary": "The code is a module that exports two functions: `getMetaData` and `useGetDrops`. \n\nThe `getMetaData` function is an asynchronous function that takes a metadataURI and an optional `from` parameter. It uses the `axios` library to make a GET request to the specified URI and returns the response data. If there is an error, it logs the error message along with the `from` and `metadataURI` parameters to the console.\n\nThe `useGetDrops` function is a React hook that returns a memoized callback function. It uses several other hooks and functions from the `hooks`, `functions`, and `state` modules. When the callback function is called, it retrieves information about all the drops from the `zooKeeper` contract and maps over them to retrieve information about each egg in the drop. It then uses the `getMetaData` function to retrieve metadata for each egg and creates an `AvailableEgg` object for each egg. Finally, it creates a `Drop` object for each drop and dispatches an `addDrops` action to the Redux store with an array of `Drop` objects. \n\nThis function is used to retrieve information about all the drops and eggs in the Zoo project and store it in the Redux store. This information can then be used by other components in the project to display information about drops and eggs to the user. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { useGetDrops } from 'path/to/zoo';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const getDrops = useGetDrops();\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    getDrops();\n  }, [getDrops]);\n\n  // rest of component code\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useGetDrops` function?\n- The `useGetDrops` function is used to retrieve information about drops and their associated eggs from the blockchain and IPFS, and then dispatches the information to the Redux store.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `getMetaData` function?\n- The `getMetaData` function is used to retrieve metadata associated with an egg from IPFS, given its metadata URI.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `convertIpfsUrl` function?\n- The `convertIpfsUrl` function is used to convert an IPFS URI to a URL that can be used to retrieve data from IPFS.",
