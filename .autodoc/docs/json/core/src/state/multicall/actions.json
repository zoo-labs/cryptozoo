  "summary": "This code defines a set of actions and an interface for a Redux store related to fetching data from multiple sources in a blockchain network. The `ListenerOptions` interface defines an object with a single property, `blocksPerFetch`, which specifies how often data should be fetched. The `addMulticallListeners` and `removeMulticallListeners` actions take in an object with three properties: `chainId`, which specifies the blockchain network to fetch data from, `calls`, which is an array of `Call` objects that specify the data to fetch, and `options`, which is an object of type `ListenerOptions`. These actions are used to add and remove listeners for fetching data from multiple sources in the blockchain network.\n\nThe `fetchingMulticallResults` action takes in an object with three properties: `chainId`, `calls`, and `fetchingBlockNumber`. This action is dispatched when the data is being fetched from the blockchain network. The `errorFetchingMulticallResults` action takes in an object with the same properties as `fetchingMulticallResults`, but is dispatched when there is an error fetching the data.\n\nThe `updateMulticallResults` action takes in an object with three properties: `chainId`, `blockNumber`, and `results`. This action is dispatched when the data has been successfully fetched from the blockchain network. The `results` property is an object with keys that correspond to the `Call` objects in the `calls` array, and values that are either strings or null.\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of actions and an interface for fetching data from multiple sources in a blockchain network. These actions can be used in a Redux store to manage the state of the data fetching process. For example, the `addMulticallListeners` action can be dispatched when a component mounts to start fetching data, and the `updateMulticallResults` action can be used to update the state of the store with the fetched data. Here is an example of how these actions can be used in a Redux store:\n\n```\nimport { createStore } from 'redux'\nimport { addMulticallListeners, updateMulticallResults } from './path/to/zoo'\n\nconst initialState = {\n  data: {}\n}\n\nfunction reducer(state = initialState, action) {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'multicall/addMulticallListeners':\n      // start fetching data\n      return state\n    case 'multicall/updateMulticallResults':\n      // update state with fetched data\n      return {\n        ...state,\n        data: {\n          ...state.data,\n          [action.chainId]: {\n            ...state.data[action.chainId],\n            [action.blockNumber]: action.results\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    default:\n      return state\n  }\n}\n\nconst store = createStore(reducer)\n\n// dispatch addMulticallListeners action to start fetching data\nstore.dispatch(addMulticallListeners({\n  chainId: 1,\n  calls: [{}, {}, {}],\n  options: { blocksPerFetch: 1 }\n}))\n\n// dispatch updateMulticallResults action to update state with fetched data\nstore.dispatch(updateMulticallResults({\n  chainId: 1,\n  blockNumber: 12345,\n  results: {\n    'call1': 'result1',\n    'call2': 'result2',\n    'call3': null\n  }\n}))\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Call` interface in the `import` statement?\n- The `Call` interface is imported from the `utils` module, but its purpose is not clear from this code alone.\n\n2. What is the `multicall` feature and how does it work?\n- The code defines several actions related to `multicall`, but it is not clear what this feature is or how it is implemented.\n\n3. What is the expected format of the `results` object in the `updateMulticallResults` action?\n- The `updateMulticallResults` action takes an object with a `results` property that is an object with string keys and string or null values. It is not clear what these keys and values represent or how they are used.",
