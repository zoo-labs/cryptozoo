  "summary": "The code in this file provides functions and hooks for interacting with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It imports various utility functions and types from other files and libraries, including `utils`, `@ethersproject/abi`, and `@ethersproject/bignumber`. \n\nThe `useCallsData` function is the lowest-level function for subscribing to contract data. It takes an array of `Call` objects, which contain the address and encoded data for a contract method call, and an optional `ListenerOptions` object. It returns an array of `CallResult` objects, which contain the result data and block number for each call. This function is used by the higher-level hooks `useSingleContractMultipleData`, `useMultipleContractSingleData`, and `useSingleCallResult`.\n\n`useSingleContractMultipleData` is a hook that takes a `Contract` object, a method name, an array of method inputs, and optional `ListenerOptions` and `gasRequired` objects. It returns an array of `CallState` objects, which contain information about the state of each method call. This hook is used when you want to call the same method on a single contract with multiple sets of inputs.\n\n`useMultipleContractSingleData` is a hook that takes an array of contract addresses, a contract interface, a method name, method inputs, and optional `ListenerOptions` and `gasRequired` objects. It returns an array of `CallState` objects, which contain information about the state of each method call. This hook is used when you want to call the same method on multiple contracts with the same inputs.\n\n`useSingleCallResult` is a hook that takes a `Contract` object, a method name, method inputs, and optional `ListenerOptions` and `gasRequired` objects. It returns a single `CallState` object, which contains information about the state of the method call. This hook is used when you want to call a single method on a single contract.\n\nThe `toCallState` function takes a `CallResult` object, a contract interface, a method fragment, and the latest block number, and returns a `CallState` object. This function is used by the higher-level hooks to convert the `CallResult` objects into `CallState` objects.\n\nOverall, this file provides a set of hooks and functions that make it easy to interact with smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. These hooks and functions can be used in a larger project to fetch data from contracts and display it in a user interface. Here is an example of how to use the `useSingleCallResult` hook:\n\n```\nimport { useSingleCallResult } from './path/to/zoo'\n\nconst MyComponent = ({ contract }) => {\n  const { result, loading, error } = useSingleCallResult(contract, 'balanceOf', ['0x123...'])\n\n  if (loading) {\n    return <div>Loading...</div>\n  }\n\n  if (error) {\n    return <div>Error fetching balance</div>\n  }\n\n  return <div>Balance: {result?.[0]}</div>\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useCallsData` function?\n- The `useCallsData` function is the lowest level call for subscribing to contract data and returns an array of `CallResult` objects.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useSingleContractMultipleData` function?\n- The `useSingleContractMultipleData` function is used to fetch multiple data points from a single contract and returns an array of `CallState` objects.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useSingleCallResult` function?\n- The `useSingleCallResult` function is used to fetch a single data point from a single contract and returns a single `CallState` object.",
