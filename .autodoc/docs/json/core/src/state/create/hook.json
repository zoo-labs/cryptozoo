  "summary": "The code is a module that exports three React hooks that can be used in the larger project. The module imports several functions and objects from other modules in the project. \n\nThe first hook, `useCreateState`, returns the `create` state from the Redux store. This hook can be used to access the current state of the create feature in the project. \n\nThe second hook, `useCreateActionHandlers`, returns an object with three functions that dispatch Redux actions to update the `create` state. The `onCurrencySelection` function takes a `Field` and a `Currency` object and dispatches a `selectCurrency` action with the selected currency and field. The `onSwitchTokens` function dispatches a `switchCurrencies` action to switch the selected collateral and asset tokens. The `onUserInput` function takes a `Field` and a string value and dispatches a `typeInput` action with the typed value and field. These functions can be used to handle user input in the create feature. \n\nThe third hook, `useDerivedCreateInfo`, returns an object with the selected collateral and asset currencies and an input error message. This hook uses other hooks from the project to derive the selected currencies from the `create` state and check for input errors. If there is no account connected, the input error is set to 'Connect Wallet'. If there is no selected collateral or asset currency, the input error is set to 'Select a collateral token' or 'Select an asset token', respectively. This hook can be used to display the selected currencies and input errors in the create feature. \n\nOverall, this module provides hooks that can be used to access and update the `create` state and derive information from it. These hooks can be used in the larger project to implement the create feature and handle user input. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { useCreateState, useCreateActionHandlers, useDerivedCreateInfo } from './createHooks'\n\nfunction CreateFeature() {\n  const { currencies, inputError } = useDerivedCreateInfo()\n  const { onCurrencySelection, onSwitchTokens, onUserInput } = useCreateActionHandlers()\n  const { independentField } = useCreateState()\n\n  // render the create feature UI with the selected currencies and input error\n  // handle user input with the action handlers\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains functions related to creating and handling trade orders in the zoo project.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies are being used in this code?\n- The code imports various functions and types from external libraries such as '@zoolabs/zdk', '@lingui/macro', and 'react'.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useDerivedCreateInfo` function?\n- The `useDerivedCreateInfo` function returns an object containing information about the selected collateral and asset currencies for a trade order, as well as any input errors. It uses various hooks and functions to derive this information from the current state of the application.",
