  "summary": "This code defines CSS variables for the root element of a webpage. These variables can be used throughout the webpage to maintain consistency in design and layout. \n\nThe `--primary` variable is set to the color black (#000), which can be used as the primary color for the webpage. The `--text-primary` variable is set to white (#fff), which can be used as the primary text color. The `--font-sans` variable is set to a font stack that includes the Inter font, as well as fallback fonts for different operating systems. This font stack can be used to set the default font for the webpage. \n\nFinally, the `--scrollbar-width` variable is set to 14 pixels. This can be used to set the width of scrollbars on the webpage, ensuring consistency across different browsers and devices. \n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and efficient way to define global variables for a webpage, making it easier to maintain a consistent design and layout. \n\nExample usage:\n\nTo use the `--primary` variable in CSS, simply reference it using the `var()` function:\n\n```\nh1 {\n  color: var(--primary);\n}\n```\n\nThis will set the color of all `h1` elements to the value of the `--primary` variable (in this case, black).\n\nSimilarly, to use the `--font-sans` variable to set the default font for the webpage, simply reference it in the `font-family` property:\n\n```\nbody {\n  font-family: var(--font-sans);\n}\n```\n\nThis will set the default font for the entire webpage to the Inter font (or a fallback font if Inter is not available).",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `:root` selector in this code?\n   - The `:root` selector is used to target the root element of the document, which in this case is likely the HTML element. The purpose of this selector is to define global CSS variables that can be used throughout the project.\n\n2. What do the CSS variables `--primary`, `--text-primary`, `--font-sans`, and `--scrollbar-width` represent?\n   - `--primary` likely represents the primary color used throughout the project, `--text-primary` represents the primary text color, `--font-sans` represents the primary font family used, and `--scrollbar-width` represents the width of scrollbars in the project.\n\n3. What is the value of the `--font-sans` variable?\n   - The value of the `--font-sans` variable is a font stack that includes the \"Inter\" font, as well as several fallback fonts. This suggests that \"Inter\" is the preferred font for the project, but other fonts will be used if \"Inter\" is not available.",
