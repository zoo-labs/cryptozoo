  "summary": "This code defines a React functional component called `OutputPanel` that renders a `CurrencyInputPanel` component with some custom props. The `CurrencyInputPanel` component is imported from a file located at `../exchange-v1/limit-order/CurrencyInputPanel`. The `OutputPanel` component takes in a single prop called `label` of type string. \n\nThe `CurrencyInputPanel` component is a custom input component that allows users to input a currency value. It consists of two main components: a select component and an input component. The select component is a `Typography` component that displays the currency symbol and label passed in as a prop. The input component is a `div` element with a custom class that styles it to look like an input field. \n\nThe `OutputPanel` component customizes the `CurrencyInputPanel` component by passing in the following props:\n- `id`: a string that sets the id of the `CurrencyInputPanel` component to \"token-output\"\n- `className`: a string that sets the class of the `CurrencyInputPanel` component to \"rounded p-0 px-5 border-2 border-dark-800 flex items-center\"\n- `selectComponent`: a JSX element that renders the `Typography` component with the `label` prop passed in as its child\n- `inputComponent`: a JSX element that renders a `div` element with a custom class that styles it to look like an input field\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that requires a custom input component for currency values. It can be imported and used in any React component that needs to display an output currency value. For example, in a financial application that displays the total value of a user's portfolio, the `OutputPanel` component can be used to display the value in the user's preferred currency. \n\nExample usage:\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport OutputPanel from './OutputPanel';\n\nconst PortfolioValue = () => {\n  const totalValue = 10000; // total value of user's portfolio\n  const currency = 'USD'; // user's preferred currency\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Portfolio Value</h2>\n      <OutputPanel label={currency} value={totalValue} />\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default PortfolioValue;\n```",
