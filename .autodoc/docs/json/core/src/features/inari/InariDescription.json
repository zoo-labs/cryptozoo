  "summary": "This code defines a React functional component called `InariDescription` that renders a header section for a specific entity in the larger project. The component imports the `React` library and the `FC` (FunctionComponent) type from the `react` module, as well as the `Typography` component and a custom hook called `useDerivedInariState` from other files in the project.\n\nThe `InariDescription` component takes no props, but uses the `useDerivedInariState` hook to retrieve the `general` object from the `inari` state. This object contains information about the entity, such as its name and description.\n\nThe component then renders a `div` element with a CSS class of `grid` and a gap of 2 units between its child elements. Inside the `div`, it renders two `Typography` components. The first one displays the name of the entity in a large font size and with a high emphasis color, while the second one displays its description in a regular font size.\n\nThis component can be used in other parts of the project to display the header section of any entity that has a `general` object in its `inari` state. For example, if the project has a `zoo` entity, the `InariDescription` component can be used to display its name and description in the header section of the `zoo` page.\n\nHere's an example of how the `InariDescription` component can be used in a `zoo` page:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport InariDescription from './InariDescription'\n\nconst ZooPage = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <InariDescription />\n      {/* other content of the zoo page */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default ZooPage\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `InariHeaderProps` interface?\n   - The `InariHeaderProps` interface is used to define the props that can be passed to the `InariDescription` component.\n\n2. What is the `useDerivedInariState` hook and where is it defined?\n   - The `useDerivedInariState` hook is defined in the `../../state/inari/hooks` file and is used to access the derived state of the `inari` slice of the Redux store.\n\n3. What is the `Typography` component and where is it defined?\n   - The `Typography` component is defined in the `../../components/Typography` file and is used to render text with different styles and variants.",
