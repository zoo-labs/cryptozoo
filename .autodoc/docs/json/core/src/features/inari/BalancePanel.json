  "summary": "The `BalancePanel` component is a React functional component that renders a panel displaying the balance of a given token and allows the user to input a value for that token. It is part of the larger `zoo` project and is used to display and manage balances in various parts of the application.\n\nThe component takes several props, including a `label` and `symbol` for the token, a `value` representing the current input value, a `balance` representing the current balance of the token, and a `field` indicating whether the input is for the input or output token. The component also has an optional `showMax` prop that, when true, displays a \"Max\" button that sets the input value to the maximum balance.\n\nThe component uses several hooks from the `inari` state, including `useDerivedInariState`, `useInariState`, and `useSelectedInariStrategy`. These hooks provide access to various state variables and functions related to the Inari protocol, which is used to swap tokens.\n\nThe `BalancePanel` component renders a panel with the token logo, a numeric input field, and a \"Max\" button (if `showMax` is true). When the user inputs a value, the `dispatchValue` function is called, which updates the input and output values in the state using the `setValues` action. If the \"Max\" button is clicked, the `onMax` function is called, which sets the input value to the maximum balance.\n\nThe `BalancePanel` component is used throughout the `zoo` project to display and manage token balances. For example, it may be used in a swap interface to allow the user to input the amount of tokens they wish to swap. Overall, the `BalancePanel` component provides a simple and reusable way to display token balances and manage user input.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code defines a React component called `BalancePanel` that displays information about a token balance and allows the user to input a value for swapping tokens.\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several modules from external libraries including `@zoolabs/zdk`, `react`, and `@lingui/react`.\n3. What props does the `BalancePanel` component accept and what is their purpose?\n- The `BalancePanel` component accepts several props including `label`, `token`, `value`, `symbol`, `balance`, `field`, and `showMax`. These props are used to display information about the token balance and to allow the user to input a value for swapping tokens.",
