  "summary": "The code above is a React component called `StrategySelector` that renders a list of strategies and allows the user to select one. The component is part of a larger project called `zoo` and imports several functions and hooks from other files in the project.\n\nThe `StrategySelector` component receives no props and uses three hooks: `useInariState`, `useInariStrategies`, and `useAppDispatch`. These hooks are used to retrieve the current strategy ID, a list of available strategies, and a dispatch function to update the state of the application.\n\nThe component renders a `div` element with a class of `flex flex-col gap-4 z-10 relative`. Inside this `div`, the component maps over the list of strategies and renders a `div` element for each one. Each `div` element has a `key` attribute set to the strategy's ID and an `onClick` event listener that dispatches an action to update the current strategy ID when the user clicks on it.\n\nThe `classNames` function is used to conditionally set the `className` attribute of each `div` element based on whether the strategy is currently selected or not. If the strategy is selected, the `className` attribute is set to `'border-gradient-r-blue-pink-dark-800'`, otherwise it is set to `'bg-dark-900'`. The `classNames` function also adds several other classes to each `div` element, including `'cursor-pointer'`, `'border'`, `'border-transparent'`, `'pl-5'`, `'py-2'`, `'rounded'`, `'whitespace-nowrap'`, `'w-full'`, `'font-bold'`, `'h-[48px]'`, `'flex'`, `'items-center'`, and `'text-sm'`. These classes are used to style the `div` elements to look like buttons.\n\nFinally, the `div` elements display the name of each strategy, which is retrieved from the `general.name` property of each strategy object.\n\nOverall, the `StrategySelector` component is a reusable UI component that allows the user to select a strategy from a list of available strategies. It is likely used in conjunction with other components and functions in the `zoo` project to provide a complete user interface for managing and analyzing data related to animal behavior. An example usage of this component might look like:\n\n```\nimport StrategySelector from './components/StrategySelector'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Select a strategy:</h1>\n      <StrategySelector />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this component and how is it used within the larger project?\n   - This component appears to be a strategy selector that is used within the Inari feature of the project. It renders a list of strategies and allows the user to select one. It is likely used in conjunction with other components to provide a complete user interface for managing Inari strategies.\n2. What is the `useInariState` hook and what data does it provide?\n   - The `useInariState` hook is imported from a file located at `../../state/inari/hooks` and appears to provide access to the current Inari state, including the selected strategy ID.\n3. What is the purpose of the `classNames` function and where is it defined?\n   - The `classNames` function is imported from a file located at `../../functions` and appears to be used to conditionally apply CSS classes to the rendered `div` element based on the current strategy ID. It likely provides a convenient way to generate complex class names based on dynamic data.",
