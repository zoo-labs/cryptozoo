  "summary": "The `StrategyStepDisplay` component is a React functional component that displays a list of steps in a strategy. It receives no props and uses the `useDerivedInariState` hook to retrieve the `general` property from the Inari state. \n\nThe component renders a `div` element with a class of `flex items-center gap-3 text-high-emphesis`. Inside this `div`, the component maps over the `general.steps` array and creates a `Typography` component for each step. The `Typography` component receives a `weight` prop of `700` and a `variant` prop of `lg`, and displays the text of the step.\n\nAfter mapping over the `general.steps` array, the component uses the `reduce` method to concatenate the `Typography` components with an `ArrowRightIcon` component in between each one. The `reduce` method takes two arguments: a callback function and an initial value. The callback function takes two arguments: an accumulator and the current value. The initial value is `null`.\n\nThe callback function checks if the accumulator is `null`. If it is, it returns the current value. If it is not, it returns a `div` element containing the accumulator, an `ArrowRightIcon` component, and the current value. The `ArrowRightIcon` component has a `width` prop of `16` and a `height` prop of `16`. The `div` element has a class of `rounded-full p-1 bg-dark-800 border-[3px] border-dark-900 relative z-10`.\n\nThe resulting JSX is then rendered inside the `div` element with the `flex items-center gap-3 text-high-emphesis` class.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display a list of steps in a strategy. For example, it could be used in a financial planning app to display the steps a user needs to take to achieve their financial goals. Here is an example of how the component could be used:\n\n```\n<StrategyStepDisplay />\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `StrategyStepDisplay` component?\n- The `StrategyStepDisplay` component is used to display a list of steps as a series of `Typography` components with an arrow icon between them.\n\n2. What is the `useDerivedInariState` hook and where is it defined?\n- The `useDerivedInariState` hook is used to access the `general` property of the Inari state. It is defined in a module located at `../../state/inari/hooks`.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `reduce` method being called on the mapped steps array?\n- The `reduce` method is used to concatenate the `Typography` components with the arrow icon in between them. It takes two arguments: an accumulator and the current value. The initial value of the accumulator is `null`, and it is replaced with the first `Typography` component. The arrow icon and the next `Typography` component are then added to the accumulator and returned for the next iteration. This process continues until all the steps have been concatenated.",
