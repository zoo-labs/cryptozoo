  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called SideSwitch that renders a toggle switch with two labels: \"Withdraw\" and \"Deposit\". The switch is implemented using the Switch component from the Headless UI library. The state of the switch is controlled by the zapIn variable obtained from the useInariState hook, which is part of the Inari state management system. The setZapIn function from the Inari actions is used to update the state of the switch when it is toggled. The labels are localized using the Lingui library, which provides internationalization support for React applications.\n\nThe SideSwitch component is likely used in a larger project that involves some kind of financial transaction system, where users can either withdraw or deposit funds. The switch allows the user to toggle between these two modes. The use of the Inari state management system suggests that the project is complex and requires a robust state management solution. The use of the Lingui library suggests that the project is intended for use in multiple languages and locales.\n\nHere is an example of how the SideSwitch component might be used in a parent component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport SideSwitch from './SideSwitch'\n\nconst TransactionForm = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>Transaction Form</h2>\n      <SideSwitch />\n      {/* other form fields */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default TransactionForm\n```\n\nIn this example, the SideSwitch component is rendered as part of a larger transaction form. The form allows the user to enter transaction details, such as the amount to withdraw or deposit. The SideSwitch component allows the user to toggle between these two modes.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and where is it used in the project?\n   - This code is a React component called `SideSwitch` that renders a switch with labels for \"Withdraw\" and \"Deposit\". It is likely used in a UI component related to financial transactions.\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?\n   - This code relies on several external libraries including `@headlessui/react`, `@heroicons/react/outline`, `@lingui/macro`, `@lingui/react`, and custom hooks from `../../state/inari/hooks` and `../../state/hooks`.\n3. What state is being managed by this component and how is it updated?\n   - The `zapIn` state is being managed by this component and is updated by dispatching the `setZapIn` action with the opposite boolean value of the current `zapIn` state when the switch is toggled. The `zapIn` state is obtained from the `useInariState` hook and the `setZapIn` action is dispatched using the `useAppDispatch` hook.",
