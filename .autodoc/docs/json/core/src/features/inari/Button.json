  "summary": "The `InariButton` component is a reusable button component that is used in the Inari section of the larger project. The purpose of this component is to provide a button that can be used to execute a transaction on the Inari strategy. The component is imported from various other files in the project, including hooks, components, and state.\n\nThe component takes in various props, including `children` and `rest`. The `children` prop is used to render the text inside the button, while the `rest` prop is used to pass any additional props to the button component.\n\nThe component uses various hooks to get the necessary data for the button. These hooks include `useLingui`, `useActiveWeb3React`, `useDerivedInariState`, `useSelectedInariStrategy`, and `useBentoMasterApproveCallback`. These hooks are used to get the user's account, the input value for the transaction, the balances, and the approval state.\n\nThe component then checks various conditions to determine what should be rendered inside the button. If the user is not connected to a wallet, the button is disabled and displays the text \"Connect Wallet\". If the user has not entered an amount for the transaction, the button is disabled and displays the text \"Enter an amount\". If the user does not have enough balance for the transaction, the button is disabled and displays the text \"Insufficient Balance\".\n\nIf the user needs to approve the transaction, the component displays a progress bar with the steps required for approval. If the approval is pending, the button is disabled and displays a loading animation. If the approval has not been granted, the button is enabled and displays the text \"Approve Inari to spend [currency symbol]\". If the approval has been granted, the button is enabled and displays the text \"Execute\".\n\nOnce the user clicks the button, the `onExecute` function is called, which sets the `pending` state to true, executes the transaction, and sets the `pending` state to false. If the user needs to get a permit to send with the execute function, the `handleGetPermit` function is called.\n\nOverall, the `InariButton` component provides a reusable button that can be used to execute transactions on the Inari strategy. The component checks various conditions to ensure that the user has entered the correct information and has the necessary approvals before executing the transaction.",
