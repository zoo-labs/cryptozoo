  "summary": "The `TransactionReviewView` function in this file is a React component that renders a transaction review. It takes a single prop, `transactionReview`, which is an array of objects representing each line of the review. Each object has three properties: `name`, `from`, and `to`, which represent the name of the transaction, the sender of the transaction, and the recipient of the transaction, respectively. Additionally, each object has a `direction` property, which is an enum value from the `Direction` enum defined in `TransactionReview.ts`.\n\nThe component first checks if `transactionReview` is truthy and has a length greater than 0. If so, it renders a heading (\"Transaction Review\") and a list of lines, where each line is rendered as a flexbox with two columns: the name of the transaction in the left column, and the sender and recipient in the right column. The direction of the transaction is indicated by an arrow icon between the sender and recipient, with the icon pointing right for a flat transaction, up for a positive transaction, and down for a negative transaction.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to display a summary of a transaction review to the user. For example, it could be used in a wallet application to show the user a summary of the transactions they have made or received. Here is an example usage of the component:\n\n```jsx\nimport TransactionReviewView from './TransactionReviewView'\n\nconst transactionReview = [\n  {\n    name: 'Transaction 1',\n    from: 'Alice',\n    to: 'Bob',\n    direction: Direction.UP,\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Transaction 2',\n    from: 'Charlie',\n    to: 'Alice',\n    direction: Direction.FLAT,\n  },\n  {\n    name: 'Transaction 3',\n    from: 'Bob',\n    to: 'Eve',\n    direction: Direction.DOWN,\n  },\n]\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TransactionReviewView transactionReview={transactionReview} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TransactionReviewView` function?\n- The `TransactionReviewView` function is a React component that renders a list of transaction review lines.\n\n2. What is the `TransactionReview` entity and where is it defined?\n- The `TransactionReview` entity is used as a type for the `transactionReview` prop passed to the `TransactionReviewView` component. It is defined in a file located at `../../entities/TransactionReview`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ArrowRight`, `ArrowUpRight`, and `ArrowDownRight` components imported from `react-feather`?\n- These components are icons that are used to indicate the direction of a transaction review line. The `ArrowRight` component is used for a flat direction, `ArrowUpRight` for an up direction, and `ArrowDownRight` for a down direction.",
