  "summary": "The `TradeReview` component is a React component that displays a summary of a trade that is about to be executed on a decentralized exchange. The component takes two props: `trade` and `allowedSlippage`. `trade` is an object that represents the trade to be executed, while `allowedSlippage` is a number that represents the maximum amount of slippage that is allowed for the trade.\n\nThe component first imports several modules from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, as well as several React components and hooks. It then defines the `TradeReview` function component, which returns a JSX element that displays the trade summary.\n\nThe component first checks if a trade object has been passed as a prop. If not, it displays a message indicating that no liquidity was found to do the swap. If a trade object is present, the component displays several pieces of information about the trade, including the minimum amount of output currency that will be received, the price impact of the trade, and the liquidity provider fee.\n\nThe component also checks if the trade has a route with more than two tokens. If so, it displays the route that the trade will take through the tokens.\n\nThe `TradeReview` component is likely used in a larger project that involves executing trades on a decentralized exchange. It provides users with a summary of the trade they are about to execute, including important information such as the minimum amount of output currency they will receive and the price impact of the trade. This information can help users make informed decisions about whether to proceed with the trade or not.",
