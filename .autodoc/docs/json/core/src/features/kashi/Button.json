  "summary": "The code in this file contains two React components: `KashiApproveButton` and `TokenApproveButton`. These components are used to handle approval of tokens in the Kashi protocol and other tokens respectively. \n\nThe `KashiApproveButton` component is used to approve the Kashi protocol to spend a user's funds. It takes in two props: `content` and `color`. The `content` prop is a function that returns a React component that will be rendered when the Kashi protocol has been approved. The `color` prop is used to set the color of the button. \n\nThe component uses the `useKashiApproveCallback` hook to get the current approval state of the Kashi protocol and to handle the approval process. If the approval state is `NOT_APPROVED` or `PENDING` and the user has not yet given a permit, the component will render a button that, when clicked, will trigger the `onApprove` function to request approval from the user. If the approval state is `APPROVED` or the user has given a permit, the `content` function is called with the `onCook` function as an argument. The resulting React component is then rendered with the `color` prop passed down.\n\nThe `TokenApproveButton` component is used to approve other tokens. It takes in four props: `children`, `value`, `token`, `needed`, and `color`. The `children` prop is a React component that will be rendered when the token has been approved. The `value` prop is the amount of tokens that need to be approved. The `token` prop is an object that contains information about the token being approved. The `needed` prop is a boolean that indicates whether approval is needed. The `color` prop is used to set the color of the button.\n\nThe component uses the `useApproveCallback` hook to get the current approval state of the token and to handle the approval process. If the approval state is `NOT_APPROVED` or `PENDING`, the component will render a button that, when clicked, will trigger the `approve` function to request approval from the user. If the approval state is `APPROVED`, the `children` component is rendered with the `color` prop passed down.\n\nThese components are used in the larger project to handle token approvals in the Kashi protocol and other tokens. They provide a simple and consistent way to handle approvals across the project. An example of how the `TokenApproveButton` component can be used is shown below:\n\n```\n<TokenApproveButton\n  value=\"100\"\n  token={{ symbol: \"USDC\", address: \"0x123...\" }}\n  needed={true}\n  color=\"primary\"\n>\n  <Button>Buy USDC</Button>\n</TokenApproveButton>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `KashiApproveButton` function?\n- The `KashiApproveButton` function is used to render a button that allows the user to approve Kashi.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `TokenApproveButton` function?\n- The `TokenApproveButton` function is used to render a button that allows the user to approve a token.\n\n3. What are the dependencies of this file?\n- This file depends on several hooks and components from other files, including `useApproveCallback`, `useKashiApproveCallback`, `Alert`, `Button`, `Dots`, `useActiveWeb3React`, and `useLingui`. It also imports constants from the `@zoolabs/zdk` package.",
