  "summary": "The `SmartNumberInput` function is a React component that renders a form input field with additional functionality for handling numeric values. The component takes in several props that allow for customization of the input field and its behavior. \n\nThe component renders two main sections: a header section and an input section. The header section displays a title, a button to toggle between using a BentoBox or a Wallet, and a maximum value. The input section displays a numeric input field and a button to set the input value to the maximum value. \n\nThe `SmartNumberInput` component is designed to be used in a larger project where numeric input fields are required. The component can be customized to fit the specific needs of the project by passing in different props. For example, the `color` prop can be used to change the color of the input field and the `useBento` prop can be used to determine whether the input value is coming from a BentoBox or a Wallet. \n\nHere is an example of how the `SmartNumberInput` component can be used in a React project:\n\n```\nimport SmartNumberInput from './SmartNumberInput'\n\nfunction MyForm() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState('')\n  const max = BigNumber.from(1000)\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <SmartNumberInput\n        color='pink'\n        token={myToken}\n        value={value}\n        setValue={setValue}\n        max={max}\n        showMax={true}\n      />\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `SmartNumberInput` component is used in a form to handle numeric input for a token. The `value` and `setValue` props are used to control the value of the input field, and the `max` prop is used to set the maximum value of the input field. The `showMax` prop is set to `true` to display the maximum value button.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n- This code defines a React component called `SmartNumberInput` that renders a form input field with some additional features such as a toggle button and a maximum value display.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code imports two components from the `react-feather` library, as well as the `BigNumber` class from the `@ethersproject/bignumber` library. It also uses two custom components called `Button` and `Input` that are presumably defined elsewhere in the project.\n\n3. What are the optional props that can be passed to this component and what do they do?\n- The `SmartNumberInput` component accepts several optional props, including `color` (which determines the color scheme of the component), `token` (which is an object containing information about a cryptocurrency token), `value` (which is the current value of the input field), `setValue` (which is a function to update the value of the input field), and several others. These props control various aspects of the component's behavior and appearance, such as whether to display a maximum value button, whether to use a BentoBox or wallet balance, and whether the component is disabled.",
