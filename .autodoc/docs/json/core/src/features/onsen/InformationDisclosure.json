  "summary": "The `InformationDisclosure` component is a React component that displays information on how to participate in a liquidity pool or Kashi market. It is used in the larger project to provide users with a clear understanding of how to participate in the project's liquidity pools and Kashi markets.\n\nThe component uses the `Disclosure` and `Transition` components from the `@headlessui/react` library to create a collapsible panel that displays the information. When the panel is closed, a `QuestionMarkCircleIcon` is displayed, and when it is open, a `XCircle` icon is displayed to close it.\n\nThe component receives a `farm` prop, which is an object that contains information about the liquidity pool or Kashi market. The component uses this information to display the appropriate instructions for participating in the pool or market.\n\nThe component uses the `Typography` component from the `../../components/Typography` file to display text. It also uses the `NavLink` component from the `../../components/NavLink` file to create links to other pages in the project.\n\nThe component is used in the larger project to provide users with a clear understanding of how to participate in the project's liquidity pools and Kashi markets. It is displayed on the project's website and can be accessed by users who are interested in participating in the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport InformationDisclosure from './InformationDisclosure'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const farm = {\n    pair: {\n      type: PairType.SWAP,\n      token0: {\n        id: '0x123',\n        symbol: 'ETH'\n      },\n      token1: {\n        id: '0x456',\n        symbol: 'USDC'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <InformationDisclosure farm={farm} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `InformationDisclosure` component?\n- The `InformationDisclosure` component is used to display information on how to participate in a farm, including steps to provide liquidity, deposit tokens, and harvest rewards.\n\n2. What libraries and components are being imported in this file?\n- The file is importing React, Fragment, `Disclosure` and `Transition` components from `@headlessui/react`, `QuestionMarkCircleIcon` from `@heroicons/react/solid`, `XCircle` from `react-feather`, `useLingui` and `t` from `@lingui/react`, `Typography` from `../../components/Typography`, `PairType` from `./enum`, and `NavLink` from `../../components/NavLink`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useLingui` hook and `t` function?\n- The `useLingui` hook is used for internationalization and localization of the text displayed in the component. The `t` function is used to translate the text into the appropriate language based on the user's locale.",
