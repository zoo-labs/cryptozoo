  "summary": "The `usePending` function is a React hook that calculates the pending rewards for a given farm. It imports several hooks and functions from other files in the project, including `useCallback`, `useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`, `useActiveWeb3React`, `useBlockNumber`, `useCloneRewarderContract`, `useComplexRewarderContract`, and `getContract`. \n\nThe function first defines an object called `REWARDERS` that maps chain IDs to rewarder contract addresses. It then defines a `usePending` function that takes a `farm` object as an argument. This `farm` object contains information about the farm, including its ID, reward token, and chef. \n\nWithin the `usePending` function, several hooks are used to get information about the current user's account, the current block number, and the rewarder contract for the given farm. The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the `contract` object, which maps chain IDs to rewarder contracts. \n\nThe `useEffect` hook is used to fetch the pending rewards for the given farm. If the user is connected to a wallet, the rewarder contract exists, and the farm is a MasterChefV2 or MiniChef farm, the `fetchPendingReward` function is called. This function uses the `pendingTokens` function of the rewarder contract to get the pending rewards for the given farm and user account. It then formats the pending rewards as a string and sets the `balance` state variable to this value. \n\nFinally, the `usePending` function returns the `balance` state variable, which represents the pending rewards for the given farm. This hook can be used in other components to display the pending rewards for a given farm. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport usePending from './path/to/usePending'\n\nfunction Farm({ farm }) {\n  const pendingRewards = usePending(farm)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h2>{farm.name}</h2>\n      <p>Pending rewards: {pendingRewards}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `usePending` function?\n- The `usePending` function is used to fetch the pending rewards for a given farm and return the formatted balance.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `REWARDERS` object?\n- The `REWARDERS` object is used to store the rewarder contract addresses for different chain IDs.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the commented out `useRewarderContract` function?\n- It is unclear what the purpose of the `useRewarderContract` function is, as it is currently commented out and not used in the code. It appears to be related to fetching a rewarder contract for a given farm, but more context is needed to understand its intended use.",
