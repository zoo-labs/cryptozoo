  "summary": "The `useMasterChef` function is a custom React hook that provides access to deposit, withdraw, and harvest functions for a given chef contract. The hook takes a `chef` parameter of type `Chef`, which is an enum that specifies the type of chef contract to interact with. \n\nThe hook uses several other hooks to retrieve the necessary data for interacting with the chef contract. The `useActiveWeb3React` hook retrieves the current user's Ethereum account, while the `useSushiContract` and `useChefContract` hooks retrieve the SushiSwap token contract and the chef contract, respectively. \n\nThe `deposit` function takes two parameters: `pid`, which is the pool ID of the pool to deposit into, and `amount`, which is the amount of tokens to deposit. The function first checks which type of chef contract is being used and then calls the appropriate `deposit` function on the contract with the given `pid` and `amount`. If the chef contract is not the `MASTERCHEF` contract, the function also passes the current user's account as a third parameter. The function returns the transaction hash of the deposit transaction.\n\nThe `withdraw` function is similar to the `deposit` function, but instead of depositing tokens, it withdraws tokens from the specified pool. The function takes the same two parameters as the `deposit` function: `pid` and `amount`. The function checks which type of chef contract is being used and then calls the appropriate `withdraw` function on the contract with the given `pid` and `amount`. If the chef contract is not the `MASTERCHEF` contract, the function also passes the current user's account as a third parameter. The function returns the transaction hash of the withdraw transaction.\n\nThe `harvest` function is used to claim rewards from the specified pool. The function takes a single parameter, `pid`, which is the pool ID of the pool to harvest rewards from. The function first checks which type of chef contract is being used and then calls the appropriate `harvest` function on the contract with the given `pid` and the current user's account. If the chef contract is the `MASTERCHEF_V2` contract, the function also checks if there are enough SUSHI tokens in the contract to harvest. If there are not enough tokens, the function batches two harvest functions together to ensure that the user receives all of their rewards. The function returns the transaction hash of the harvest transaction.\n\nOverall, this hook provides a convenient way for developers to interact with chef contracts in the SushiSwap ecosystem. Developers can use this hook to build interfaces that allow users to deposit, withdraw, and claim rewards from various pools. Here is an example of how this hook might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport { useMasterChef, Chef } from 'zoo'\n\nfunction Pool({ pid }) {\n  const { deposit, withdraw, harvest } = useMasterChef(Chef.MASTERCHEF_V2)\n\n  const handleDeposit = async (amount) => {\n    const tx = await deposit(pid, amount)\n    console.log(`Deposit transaction hash: ${tx.hash}`)\n  }\n\n  const handleWithdraw = async (amount) => {\n    const tx = await withdraw(pid, amount)\n    console.log(`Withdraw transaction hash: ${tx.hash}`)\n  }\n\n  const handleHarvest = async () => {\n    const tx = await harvest(pid)\n    console.log(`Harvest transaction hash: ${tx.hash}`)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => handleDeposit(100)}>Deposit</button>\n      <button onClick={() => handleWithdraw(100)}>Withdraw</button>\n      <button onClick={() => handleHarvest()}>Harvest</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Pool` component uses the `useMasterChef` hook to retrieve the `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `harvest` functions for the `MASTERCHEF_V2` contract. The component then defines three event handlers that call these functions with the appropriate parameters when the user clicks on the corresponding buttons. When a transaction is successfully executed, the component logs the transaction hash to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useMasterChef` function?\n- The `useMasterChef` function returns an object with three functions: `deposit`, `withdraw`, and `harvest`, which are used to interact with a smart contract related to a specific chef.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `Chef` enum?\n- The `Chef` enum is used to determine which chef's contract to interact with, as different chefs have different functions and parameters.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `harvest` function and how does it work?\n- The `harvest` function is used to claim rewards from the chef's contract. Depending on the chef, it may involve different steps such as checking pending rewards, batching in a harvest, or simply calling the `harvest` function.",
