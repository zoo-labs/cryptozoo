  "summary": "The `CurrencyInputPanel` component is a reusable UI component that provides an input field for users to enter a currency amount, along with an optional button to set the input field to the maximum available balance for the selected currency. The component also displays the currency symbol and logo, along with the current balance and fiat value of the selected currency.\n\nThe component takes in several props, including the current value of the input field, a callback function to handle user input, a boolean flag to show or hide the \"max\" button, the current balance of the selected currency, the fiat value of the selected currency, and various other optional flags to customize the appearance of the component.\n\nInternally, the component uses several other components and hooks from the `@zoolabs/zdk`, `@heroicons/react/outline`, `@lingui/react`, and `lottie-react` libraries to render the currency logo, fiat value, and animation for the \"max\" button. The component also uses the `classNames` and `formatCurrencyAmount` functions from the `../../functions` module to apply CSS classes and format currency amounts, respectively.\n\nOverall, the `CurrencyInputPanel` component provides a flexible and customizable input field for users to enter currency amounts, along with useful information about the selected currency's balance and fiat value. This component can be used in various parts of the larger project, such as in trading interfaces or wallet management pages. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport { CurrencyAmount, Currency } from \"@zoolabs/zdk\";\nimport CurrencyInputPanel from \"./CurrencyInputPanel\";\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [value, setValue] = useState(\"\");\n  const currencyBalance = new CurrencyAmount<Currency>(Currency.ETH, \"10.0\");\n\n  const handleUserInput = useCallback((val) => {\n    setValue(val);\n  }, []);\n\n  const handleMax = useCallback(() => {\n    setValue(currencyBalance.toExact());\n  }, [currencyBalance]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CurrencyInputPanel\n        value={value}\n        onUserInput={handleUserInput}\n        onMax={handleMax}\n        showMaxButton={true}\n        currencyBalance={currencyBalance}\n        fiatValue={null}\n        currency={Currency.ETH}\n        hideBalance={false}\n        hideInput={false}\n        hideIcon={false}\n        priceImpact={null}\n        id=\"my-currency-input\"\n        showCommonBases={false}\n        renderBalance={null}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
