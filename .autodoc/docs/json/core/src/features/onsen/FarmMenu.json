  "summary": "The `Menu` component in the `zoo` project is responsible for rendering a menu of links to different farms. The farms are filtered based on the chain ID and the user's account. The component imports several dependencies, including `ChainId` from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, `NavLink` from the `../../components/NavLink` file, and two hooks from the `../../hooks` and `../../state/application/hooks` files.\n\nThe `Menu` component takes a single prop, `positionsLength`, which is not used in the component. The component then uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the user's account and chain ID. It also uses the `useWalletModalToggle` hook to toggle the wallet modal when the user clicks on the \"Your Farms\" link.\n\nThe component then renders a list of links to different farms. If the user is logged in (`account` is truthy), the \"Your Farms\" link is an active link that takes the user to their portfolio of farms. If the user is not logged in, the \"Your Farms\" link is a non-active link that opens the wallet modal when clicked.\n\nThe component then renders a horizontal divider and links to \"All Farms\", \"Kashi Farms\", \"SushiSwap Farms\", and \"2x Reward Farms\". The \"Kashi Farms\" and \"SushiSwap Farms\" links are only rendered if the chain ID is `ChainId.MAINNET`. The \"2x Reward Farms\" link is only rendered if the chain ID is `ChainId.MAINNET` or `ChainId.MATIC`.\n\nOverall, the `Menu` component provides a convenient way for users to navigate to different farms in the `zoo` project. Developers can use this component in the larger project by importing it and rendering it wherever a menu of farm links is needed. For example, the component could be used in the project's header or sidebar to provide easy access to different farms.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Menu` component?\n   - The `Menu` component is responsible for rendering a menu of links to different farms based on the user's account and chain ID.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `useActiveWeb3React` and `useWalletModalToggle` hooks?\n   - The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to retrieve the user's account and chain ID from the active Web3 provider, while the `useWalletModalToggle` hook is used to toggle the display of the wallet modal.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `NavLink` component?\n   - The `NavLink` component is used to create links that are aware of the current route and can apply custom styles when active.",
