  "summary": "The `FarmList` component is a React component that renders a list of farms. It receives two props: `farms`, which is an array of farm objects, and `term`, which is a search term used to filter the farms. \n\nThe component uses the `useSortableData` hook to enable sorting of the farms by different criteria such as symbol, TVL, and APR. The sorting is triggered by clicking on the corresponding column header, which calls the `requestSort` function with the appropriate key. The current sort configuration is stored in the `sortConfig` object, which is used to display an up or down arrow next to the column header to indicate the sort direction.\n\nThe component also uses the `useInfiniteScroll` hook to enable infinite scrolling of the farms. The `numDisplayed` state variable keeps track of the number of farms currently displayed, and is updated by the `setNumDisplayed` function when the user scrolls to the bottom of the list. The `InfiniteScroll` component from the `react-infinite-scroll-component` library is used to detect when the user has reached the bottom of the list and trigger the loading of more farms.\n\nEach farm in the list is rendered using the `FarmListItem` component, which receives a single `farm` prop. The `FarmListItem` component is not shown in this code snippet, but it is likely responsible for rendering the individual farm details such as the farm name, symbol, TVL, and APR.\n\nOverall, the `FarmList` component provides a flexible and interactive way to display and sort a list of farms, while also enabling infinite scrolling to handle large lists. It can be used as a standalone component or as part of a larger project that involves displaying and managing farms. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport FarmList from './FarmList'\n\nconst farms = [\n  { symbol: 'ETH-USDT', tvl: 1000000, roiPerYear: 0.1 },\n  { symbol: 'BTC-USDT', tvl: 2000000, roiPerYear: 0.2 },\n  { symbol: 'USDC-USDT', tvl: 3000000, roiPerYear: 0.3 },\n]\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <FarmList farms={farms} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useSortableData` hook?\n   - The `useSortableData` hook is used to sort the `farms` array based on the user's request.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `InfiniteScroll` component?\n   - The `InfiniteScroll` component is used to render a list of `FarmListItem` components and load more items as the user scrolls down the page.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Dots` component?\n   - The `Dots` component is used to display a loading animation while the `farms` data is being fetched.",
