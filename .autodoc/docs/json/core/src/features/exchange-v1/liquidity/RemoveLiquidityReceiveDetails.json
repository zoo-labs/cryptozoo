  "summary": "The `RemoveLiquidityReceiveDetails` component is responsible for rendering the details of the assets that a user will receive after removing liquidity from a pool. It takes in several props including `currencyA`, `amountA`, `currencyB`, `amountB`, `hasWETH`, `hasETH`, and `id`. \n\nThe component first checks if the `chainId`, `currencyA`, and `currencyB` props are defined. If any of these are missing, it throws an error. \n\nThe component then renders a container with an `id` and a dark background. Inside this container, there are two main sections. The first section displays the assets that the user will receive after removing liquidity. If the pool contains WETH, the component will display a link to receive WETH. If the pool contains ETH, the component will display a link to receive ETH. If the pool contains neither, this section will not be displayed. \n\nThe second section displays the details of the two assets that the user will receive. It renders two boxes side by side, each containing the logo, amount, and symbol of the asset. \n\nThis component is likely used in a larger project that involves removing liquidity from a pool. It provides a clear and concise summary of the assets that the user will receive after removing liquidity, which can help users make informed decisions about their transactions. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<RemoveLiquidityReceiveDetails\n  currencyA={currencyA}\n  amountA={amountA}\n  currencyB={currencyB}\n  amountB={amountB}\n  hasWETH={hasWETH}\n  hasETH={hasETH}\n  id=\"remove-liquidity-receive-details\"\n/>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and where is it used in the project?\n- This code defines a React component called `RemoveLiquidityReceiveDetails` that displays details about the assets a user will receive when removing liquidity from a pool. It is likely used in a page or modal related to liquidity removal.\n\n2. What are the required dependencies for this component to function properly?\n- The component requires `currencyA`, `amountA`, `currencyB`, `amountB`, `hasWETH`, `hasETH`, and `id` props to be passed in. Additionally, the `useActiveWeb3React` hook must be available and provide a `chainId` value, and `@zoolabs/zdk` must be installed as a dependency.\n\n3. What happens if one or more of the required dependencies are missing?\n- If `chainId`, `currencyA`, or `currencyB` are missing, the component will throw an error with the message \"missing dependencies\".",
