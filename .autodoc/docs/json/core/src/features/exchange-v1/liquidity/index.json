  "summary": "This code exports several components from different files within the `zoo` project. These components are related to liquidity details and pricing within the project. \n\nThe `AdvancedLiquidityDetails` component provides advanced details about liquidity, while the `AdvancedLiquidityDetailsDropdown` component provides a dropdown menu for selecting different liquidity details. The `LiquidityHeader` component displays a header for liquidity-related information, and the `LiquidityPrice` component displays the price of liquidity. Finally, the `RemoveLiquidityReceiveDetails` component provides details about receiving liquidity after it has been removed. \n\nThese components can be used in different parts of the `zoo` project to display and manage liquidity-related information. For example, the `LiquidityHeader` component could be used on a page that displays information about a specific liquidity pool, while the `RemoveLiquidityReceiveDetails` component could be used on a page that allows users to remove liquidity from a pool and receive their share of the assets. \n\nTo use these components in a React application, they can be imported using the `import` statement and then rendered within the application's JSX code. For example, to render the `LiquidityHeader` component, the following code could be used:\n\n```\nimport { LiquidityHeader } from 'zoo';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <LiquidityHeader />\n      // other content\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n``` \n\nOverall, this code provides a way for different parts of the `zoo` project to access and use components related to liquidity details and pricing.",
