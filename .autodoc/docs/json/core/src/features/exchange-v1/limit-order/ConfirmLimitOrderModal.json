  "summary": "The `ConfirmLimitOrderModal` component is a React functional component that renders a modal for confirming a limit order. The modal is composed of two parts: the top content and the bottom content. The top content displays the details of the limit order, including the amount of input currency to be paid, the exchange rate, and the amount of output currency to be received. The bottom content displays additional details of the limit order, including the minimum amount of output currency to be received, the order expiration time, and the recipient address. The bottom content also includes a button to confirm the limit order.\n\nThe `ConfirmLimitOrderModal` component imports several functions and hooks from other files in the project. The `formatNumber` and `shortenAddress` functions are used to format numbers and addresses, respectively. The `useActiveWeb3React` and `useUSDCPrice` hooks are used to retrieve the active Web3 provider and the current USDC price, respectively. The `useDerivedLimitOrderInfo` and `useLimitOrderState` hooks are used to retrieve the derived limit order information and the limit order state, respectively.\n\nThe `ConfirmLimitOrderModal` component also imports several components from other files in the project. The `Button` component is used to render the confirm button. The `ConfirmationModalContent` component is used to render the modal content. The `CurrencyLogo` component is used to render the logos of the input and output currencies. The `Modal` component is used to render the modal.\n\nThe `ConfirmLimitOrderModal` component exports itself as the default export of the file, which can be imported and used in other files in the project.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport ConfirmLimitOrderModal from \"./ConfirmLimitOrderModal\";\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);\n\n  const handleOpen = () => {\n    setOpen(true);\n  };\n\n  const handleClose = () => {\n    setOpen(false);\n  };\n\n  const handleConfirm = () => {\n    // Handle limit order confirmation\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Button onClick={handleOpen}>Open Confirm Limit Order Modal</Button>\n      <ConfirmLimitOrderModal\n        open={open}\n        onDismiss={handleClose}\n        onConfirm={handleConfirm}\n      />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```",
