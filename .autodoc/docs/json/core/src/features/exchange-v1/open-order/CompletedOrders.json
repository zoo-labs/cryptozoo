  "summary": "This code defines a React functional component called `CompletedOrders` that displays a list of completed orders. The component imports several dependencies, including `React`, `Badge`, `CurrencyLogo`, `Lottie`, `OrderStatus`, `Pagination`, `loadingCircle`, `t`, `useLimitOrders`, and `useLingui`. \n\nThe `CompletedOrders` component uses the `useLimitOrders` hook to retrieve a list of completed orders. If there are completed orders, the component displays a header with the total number of completed orders, a table of completed orders, and a pagination component. If there are no completed orders, the component displays a message indicating that there are no orders.\n\nThe table of completed orders displays the following columns: \n\n- Receive: The token that the user received in the trade.\n- Pay: The token that the user paid in the trade.\n- Rate: The exchange rate between the two tokens.\n- Filled: The status of the order (filled, cancelled, or expired).\n\nEach row in the table represents a completed order and displays the following information:\n\n- The amount of the token that the user received.\n- The symbol of the token that the user received.\n- The amount of the token that the user paid.\n- The symbol of the token that the user paid.\n- The exchange rate between the two tokens.\n- The status of the order.\n\nThe background color of each row depends on the status of the order. If the order is filled, the background color is green. If the order is cancelled, the background color is gray. If the order is expired, the background color is red.\n\nThe `Pagination` component allows the user to navigate between pages of completed orders.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that involves trading tokens. It provides a way for users to view their order history and track the status of their completed orders. The component can be customized to fit the design of the larger project. For example, the colors of the rows can be changed to match the color scheme of the project.",
