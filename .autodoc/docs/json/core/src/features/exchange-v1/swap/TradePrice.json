  "summary": "The `TradePrice` component is a React component that displays the exchange rate between two currencies. It takes in a `Price` object from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, which represents the exchange rate between two currencies, and a boolean `showInverted` flag that determines whether to display the exchange rate in the base-to-quote or quote-to-base direction. The component also takes in a `setShowInverted` function that updates the `showInverted` flag, and an optional `className` string for custom styling.\n\nThe component first uses the `useLingui` hook from the `@lingui/react` library to access the current language and translation functions. It then formats the exchange rate using the `toSignificant` method of the `Price` object, which returns a string representation of the exchange rate with a specified number of significant digits. If `showInverted` is true, the exchange rate is displayed in the quote-to-base direction, and if it is false, the exchange rate is displayed in the base-to-quote direction. If an error occurs during formatting, the exchange rate is set to \"0\".\n\nThe component then generates two label strings based on the `showInverted` flag and the currencies in the `Price` object. The `flipPrice` function is a callback that toggles the `showInverted` flag when the component is clicked.\n\nFinally, the component returns a div element with the exchange rate and labels displayed, along with an icon that indicates that the exchange rate can be flipped by clicking on the component. The component also applies custom styling based on the `className` prop.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that involves currency exchange, such as a cryptocurrency trading platform. It provides a user-friendly way to display exchange rates and allows users to easily switch between base-to-quote and quote-to-base rates. Here is an example of how the component can be used in a React application:\n\n```\nimport { Currency, Price } from \"@zoolabs/zdk\";\nimport TradePrice from \"./TradePrice\";\n\nfunction App() {\n  const price = new Price(new Currency(\"USD\"), new Currency(\"EUR\"), \"1.2345\");\n  const [showInverted, setShowInverted] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TradePrice\n        price={price}\n        showInverted={showInverted}\n        setShowInverted={setShowInverted}\n        className=\"my-trade-price\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TradePrice` component?\n- The `TradePrice` component is used to display the exchange rate between two currencies in a specific format.\n\n2. What external libraries are being used in this code?\n- The code is importing `Currency` and `Price` from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, as well as `Typography`, `classNames`, `t`, and `useLingui` from other external libraries.\n\n3. What happens if there is an error when formatting the price?\n- If there is an error when formatting the price, the `formattedPrice` variable is set to the string \"0\".",
