  "summary": "This code exports a React component called `SwapModalFooter` that renders the footer section of a swap modal. The component takes in four props: `trade`, `onConfirm`, `swapErrorMessage`, and `disabledConfirm`. \n\nThe `trade` prop is an object of type `V2Trade` that represents the trade being made. The `onConfirm` prop is a function that is called when the user confirms the swap. The `swapErrorMessage` prop is a ReactNode that represents an error message to be displayed if the swap fails. The `disabledConfirm` prop is a boolean that determines whether the confirm button is disabled.\n\nThe component renders a `div` element with a dark background color and some padding. Inside this `div`, there is a `ButtonError` component that represents the confirm button. When clicked, the `onConfirm` function is called. The button is disabled if the `disabledConfirm` prop is true. The text of the button is localized using the `i18n` object from the `useLingui` hook.\n\nIf the `swapErrorMessage` prop is not null, the component also renders a `SwapCallbackError` component that displays the error message.\n\nThe commented-out code inside the `div` element appears to be some additional UI elements that were not included in the final version of the component.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that involves swapping between different currencies. It provides a reusable footer section for the swap modal that includes a confirm button and the ability to display error messages. The `trade` prop allows the component to display information about the trade being made, such as the price and liquidity provider fee. The `disabledConfirm` prop allows the parent component to disable the confirm button if necessary, such as when the user has not entered all required information.",
