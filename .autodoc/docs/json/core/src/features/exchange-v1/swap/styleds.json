  "summary": "This code file imports several libraries and exports a few styled components and a React function component. \n\nThe `React` and `ReactNode` libraries are imported from the `react` package. The `styled` and `css` libraries are imported from the `styled-components` package. The `AlertTriangle` icon is imported from the `react-feather` package. The `Slider` component is imported from the `rc-slider` package.\n\nThe `ArrowWrapper` styled component is exported. It takes a boolean `clickable` prop and applies padding to the component. If `clickable` is true, it also applies a hover effect that changes the cursor to a pointer and reduces the opacity of the component.\n\nThe `BottomGrouping` styled component is exported. It applies a margin to the top of the component.\n\nThe `SwapCallbackError` function component is exported. It takes an object with an error property that can be any valid React node. It returns a div that contains the `AlertTriangle` icon and the error message.\n\nThe `StyledSlider` styled component is exported. It applies custom styles to the `Slider` component imported from `rc-slider`. It sets the margin, width, and color of the slider. It also sets the color of the slider marks, rail, track, handle, and dot.\n\nThese styled components and function component can be used in other components of the `zoo` project to create a consistent look and feel. For example, the `ArrowWrapper` component can be used to wrap arrow icons that should be clickable. The `StyledSlider` component can be used to create sliders with a custom appearance. The `SwapCallbackError` component can be used to display error messages in a consistent format.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ArrowWrapper` component and how is it used?\n   - The `ArrowWrapper` component is a styled div that can be made clickable based on the `clickable` prop. It is likely used to wrap an arrow icon or element that can be clicked to trigger an action.\n2. What is the `StyledSlider` component and what are its styled sub-components?\n   - The `StyledSlider` component is a styled version of the `Slider` component from the `rc-slider` library. Its styled sub-components include the rail, track, handle, and dot of the slider, as well as the text labels for the marks.\n3. What is the purpose of the `SwapCallbackError` component and what does it render?\n   - The `SwapCallbackError` component renders an error message with a red alert icon. It takes an `error` prop that can be any React node, likely a string or JSX element, to display as the error message.",
