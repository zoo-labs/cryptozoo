  "summary": "The code in this file is responsible for confirming a user's intention to proceed with a trade based on the price impact of the trade. The code imports two constants, ALLOWED_PRICE_IMPACT_HIGH and PRICE_IMPACT_WITHOUT_FEE_CONFIRM_MIN, from a file located in the project's constants directory. It also imports the Percent class from the '@zoolabs/zdk' package.\n\nThe confirmPriceImpactWithoutFee function takes in a priceImpactWithoutFee parameter, which is the price impact of the trade without the fee. The function then checks if the price impact is greater than or equal to PRICE_IMPACT_WITHOUT_FEE_CONFIRM_MIN. If it is, the function prompts the user to confirm their intention to proceed with the trade by typing the word \"confirm\". If the user types \"confirm\", the function returns true, indicating that the trade can proceed. If the user does not type \"confirm\", the function returns false, indicating that the trade should not proceed.\n\nIf the price impact is less than PRICE_IMPACT_WITHOUT_FEE_CONFIRM_MIN, the function checks if it is greater than or equal to ALLOWED_PRICE_IMPACT_HIGH. If it is, the function prompts the user to confirm their intention to proceed with the trade by displaying a confirmation dialog box. If the user clicks \"OK\", the function returns true, indicating that the trade can proceed. If the user clicks \"Cancel\", the function returns false, indicating that the trade should not proceed.\n\nIf the price impact is less than ALLOWED_PRICE_IMPACT_HIGH, the function returns true, indicating that the trade can proceed without any confirmation.\n\nThis function is likely used in the larger project to ensure that users are aware of the potential price impact of their trades and to prevent accidental or unintended trades with high price impacts. Here is an example of how this function might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport confirmPriceImpactWithoutFee from './path/to/confirmPriceImpactWithoutFee'\n\nconst priceImpactWithoutFee = new Percent(0.05) // 5% price impact without fee\nconst shouldProceed = confirmPriceImpactWithoutFee(priceImpactWithoutFee)\n\nif (shouldProceed) {\n  // proceed with trade\n} else {\n  // do not proceed with trade\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What are the values of `ALLOWED_PRICE_IMPACT_HIGH` and `PRICE_IMPACT_WITHOUT_FEE_CONFIRM_MIN`?\n   - `ALLOWED_PRICE_IMPACT_HIGH` and `PRICE_IMPACT_WITHOUT_FEE_CONFIRM_MIN` are constants imported from a file located at `../../../constants`.\n2. What is the purpose of the `Percent` class imported from `@zoolabs/zdk`?\n   - The `Percent` class is likely used to represent percentage values in the code, possibly including the `priceImpactWithoutFee` parameter.\n3. What happens if the user does not confirm the price impact for the swap?\n   - If the user does not confirm the price impact for the swap, the function will return `false`.",
