  "summary": "The code is a React component that displays advanced swap details for a given trade. It imports various modules from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, as well as other components and functions from the project. \n\nThe `AdvancedSwapDetails` component takes in a `trade` object, which is a V2Trade instance from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, as well as an `allowedSlippage` percentage and an optional `minerBribe` string. It then uses this information to compute and display various details about the trade.\n\nThe component first computes the `realizedLPFee` and `priceImpact` of the trade using the `computeRealizedLPFeePercent` function from the `prices` module. It then displays the `SwapRoute` for the trade, which is a component that shows the path of tokens that the trade will take. \n\nNext, the component displays the minimum received or maximum sent amount for the trade, depending on the trade type. It also displays the `priceImpact` of the trade, which is the difference between the market price and estimated price due to trade size. \n\nThe component then displays the `realizedLPFee`, which is the portion of each trade (0.25%) that goes to liquidity providers as a protocol incentive, as well as the `xSUSHI` fee, which is the portion of each trade (0.05%) that goes to `xSUSHI` holders as a protocol incentive. \n\nFinally, the component displays the `allowedSlippage` percentage and the `minerBribe`, if provided. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to display detailed information about a trade, which can be useful for users who want to understand the details of their trades. It can also be used to help users make informed decisions about their trades by displaying important details such as the minimum received or maximum sent amount, the price impact, and the fees associated with the trade. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { AdvancedSwapDetails } from \"./AdvancedSwapDetails\";\n\nconst trade = ... // create a V2Trade instance\nconst allowedSlippage = new Percent(50, 10000); // 0.5%\nconst minerBribe = \"0.01\"; // ETH\n\n<AdvancedSwapDetails trade={trade} allowedSlippage={allowedSlippage} minerBribe={minerBribe} />\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AdvancedSwapDetails` component?\n- The `AdvancedSwapDetails` component is used to display details about a trade, including the route, minimum received/maximum sent, price impact, liquidity provider fee, xSUSHI fee, and slippage tolerance.\n\n2. What libraries and hooks are being imported in this file?\n- The file is importing several libraries and hooks, including `@zoolabs/zdk`, `React`, `useMemo`, `@lingui/macro`, and `useActiveWeb3React`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `realizedLPFee` and `priceImpact` variables?\n- The `realizedLPFee` variable calculates the liquidity provider fee for a trade, while the `priceImpact` variable calculates the difference between the market price and estimated price due to trade size. These variables are used to display information about fees and price impact in the `AdvancedSwapDetails` component.",
