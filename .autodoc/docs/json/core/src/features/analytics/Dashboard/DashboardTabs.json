  "summary": "This code is a React component that renders a set of tabs for a dashboard view. The component imports a `Tabs` component from a file located at `./../Tabs`. The `Tabs` component is likely a reusable component that renders a set of tabs based on an array of tab objects. \n\nThe `DashboardTabs` component defines an array of tab objects called `tabs`. Each tab object has a `name` property and a `type` property. The `name` property is a string that represents the name of the tab, and the `type` property is a string that represents the type of data that the tab displays. \n\nThe `DashboardTabs` component takes two props: `currentType` and `setType`. The `currentType` prop is a string that represents the currently selected tab type, and the `setType` prop is a function that updates the currently selected tab type. \n\nThe `DashboardTabs` component renders the `Tabs` component and passes in the `tabs` array, `currentType`, and `setType` props. This causes the `Tabs` component to render a set of tabs based on the `tabs` array, with the currently selected tab highlighted based on the `currentType` prop. When a user clicks on a tab, the `setType` function is called with the `type` property of the clicked tab object as an argument, which updates the `currentType` prop and causes the `Tabs` component to re-render with the newly selected tab highlighted.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to render a set of tabs for a dashboard view that allows users to switch between different types of data. For example, in a cryptocurrency trading platform, the `Top Farms` tab could display a list of the top liquidity pools, the `Top Pairs` tab could display a list of the top trading pairs, and the `Top Tokens` tab could display a list of the top tokens by market cap. The `DashboardTabs` component could be used to render these tabs and allow users to switch between them to view different types of data. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport DashboardTabs from './DashboardTabs'\n\nfunction Dashboard() {\n  const [currentType, setCurrentType] = useState('pools')\n\n  function setType(type) {\n    setCurrentType(type)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <DashboardTabs currentType={currentType} setType={setType} />\n      {/* render data based on currentType */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Tabs` import and where is it located?\n- The `Tabs` import is used in this file and is located in a file located at `./../Tabs`.\n2. What is the expected data structure of the `tabs` array?\n- The `tabs` array is expected to contain objects with a `name` property (string) and a `type` property (string).\n3. What is the expected input for the `DashboardTabs` function and what does it return?\n- The `DashboardTabs` function expects two props: `currentType` (string) and `setType` (function). It returns a JSX element that renders the `Tabs` component with the `tabs`, `currentType`, and `setType` props passed in.",
