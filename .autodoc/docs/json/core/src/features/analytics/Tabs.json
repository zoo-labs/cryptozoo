  "summary": "The code defines a React component called Tabs that takes in an array of tabs, the current type of tab, and a function to set the type of tab. The purpose of this component is to render a set of tabs with names and types, and allow the user to switch between them by clicking on the tab. \n\nThe component uses the classNames function from a separate file to conditionally apply CSS classes to the tab elements based on their type and whether they are currently selected. The classNames function takes in a list of strings and returns a single string with the classes concatenated together. \n\nThe component renders a div with a border at the top and bottom, and a navigation element containing the tab elements. Each tab element is a div with a name and a type, and is rendered using the map function to iterate over the array of tabs passed in as a prop. The onClick function is used to call the setType function with the type of the clicked tab, which updates the currentType state variable and causes the component to re-render with the new tab selected. \n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display a set of tabs for navigating between different sections or views. The tabs can be customized by passing in an array of objects with different names and types, and the component will handle rendering and switching between them. Here is an example usage of the Tabs component:\n\n```\nimport Tabs from './Tabs'\n\nconst tabs = [\n  { name: 'Tab 1', type: 'tab1' },\n  { name: 'Tab 2', type: 'tab2' },\n  { name: 'Tab 3', type: 'tab3' }\n]\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [currentType, setCurrentType] = useState('tab1')\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Tabs tabs={tabs} currentType={currentType} setType={setCurrentType} />\n      {currentType === 'tab1' && <div>Tab 1 content</div>}\n      {currentType === 'tab2' && <div>Tab 2 content</div>}\n      {currentType === 'tab3' && <div>Tab 3 content</div>}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the Tabs component is passed an array of three tabs with different names and types. The currentType state variable is initialized to 'tab1', so the first tab is selected by default. The content for each tab is conditionally rendered based on the currentType variable. When the user clicks on a different tab, the setType function is called with the new type, causing the component to re-render with the new tab selected and the corresponding content displayed.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Tabs` component?\n- The `Tabs` component is used to render a set of tabs based on the `tabs` prop and handle tab selection based on the `currentType` and `setType` props.\n\n2. What is the `classNames` function and where is it imported from?\n- The `classNames` function is imported from a file located at `../../functions` and is used to conditionally concatenate CSS class names based on the provided arguments.\n\n3. What is the expected shape of the `tabs` prop?\n- The `tabs` prop is expected to be an array of objects, where each object represents a tab and has a `name` and `type` property.",
