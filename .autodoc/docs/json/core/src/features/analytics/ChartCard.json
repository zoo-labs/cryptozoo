  "summary": "The `ChartCard` component is responsible for rendering a card that displays a chart along with some related information. The component takes in several props, including `header`, `subheader`, `figure`, `change`, `chart`, `currentTimespan`, `timespans`, and `setTimespan`. \n\nThe `header` and `subheader` props are used to display some text information at the top of the card. The `figure` and `change` props are used to display a numerical value and its change over the past 24 hours, respectively. The `chart` prop is used to display a line graph, and the `currentTimespan`, `timespans`, and `setTimespan` props are used to allow the user to switch between different time spans for the chart.\n\nThe component is implemented using JSX and Tailwind CSS classes. The `classNames` function is imported from a `functions` module, and is used to conditionally apply different CSS classes based on the state of the component. The `formatNumber` function is also imported from the `functions` module, and is used to format the `figure` prop as a string with commas and an optional decimal point.\n\nThe `ColoredNumber` component is imported from a `ColoredNumber` module, and is used to display the `change` prop as a colored number with a percentage sign. The `LineGraph` component is imported from a `LineGraph` module, and is used to display the `chart` prop as a line graph with a gradient stroke.\n\nOverall, the `ChartCard` component provides a reusable way to display a chart with related information in a visually appealing and interactive way. It can be used in a larger project to display various types of data, such as financial data or user analytics. Here is an example of how the component might be used:\n\n```\n<ChartCard\n  header=\"Total Revenue\"\n  subheader=\"Last 7 Days\"\n  figure={1234567.89}\n  change={-0.05}\n  chart={chartData}\n  currentTimespan=\"Last 7 Days\"\n  timespans={[\"Last 24 Hours\", \"Last 7 Days\", \"Last 30 Days\"]}\n  setTimespan={handleTimespanChange}\n/>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What does the `ChartCard` component do?\n- The `ChartCard` component takes in several props including header, subheader, figure, change, chart, currentTimespan, timespans, and setTimespan, and returns a JSX element that displays a chart with a header, subheader, figure, and change, as well as buttons to change the timespan of the chart.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several functions and components from external dependencies including `classNames` and `formatNumber` from a file located in a `functions` directory, `ColoredNumber` and `LineGraph` components from files located in a `components` directory.\n\n3. What styling classes are applied to the returned JSX element?\n- The returned JSX element has several styling classes applied to it including `w-full`, `p-5`, `space-y-4`, `font-bold`, `border`, `rounded`, `bg-dark-900`, and `border-dark-700` on the outermost `div`, as well as various text and background color classes applied to the inner elements.",
