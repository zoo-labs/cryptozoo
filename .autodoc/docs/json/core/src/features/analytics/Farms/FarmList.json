  "summary": "The `FarmList` component is a React component that renders a table of farming pools. It takes an array of `pools` as a prop, where each pool is an object containing information about the pool's pair, rewards, liquidity, and APR. The component uses several other components and hooks to render the table, including `Table`, `DoubleCurrencyLogo`, `useCurrency`, `Image`, `ColoredNumber`, `formatNumber`, `formatNumberScale`, and `formatPercent`.\n\nThe `FarmListName` component is a subcomponent of `FarmList` that renders the name and logo of a pool's pair. It takes a `pair` prop, which is an object containing information about the pair's tokens, name, and type. It uses the `useCurrency` hook to get the currency objects for the pair's tokens, and the `DoubleCurrencyLogo` component to render the pair's logo.\n\nThe `Rewards` component is another subcomponent of `FarmList` that renders the rewards for a pool. It takes a `rewards` prop, which is an array of objects containing information about each reward's icon, token, and reward per day. It uses the `Image` component to render each reward's icon, and the `formatNumber` function to format each reward's reward per day.\n\nThe `FarmList` component uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the `defaultSortBy` and `columns` variables. `defaultSortBy` is an object that specifies the default sorting for the table, and `columns` is an array of objects that specify the columns of the table. Each column object has a `Header` property that specifies the column header, an `accessor` property that specifies the data accessor for the column, a `Cell` property that specifies the cell renderer for the column, and an `align` property that specifies the alignment of the column. The `apr` column also has a `sortType` property that specifies a custom sorting function based on the annual APR.\n\nFinally, the `FarmList` component renders the `Table` component with the `columns` and `data` props, and the `defaultSortBy` prop if specified. If `pools` is falsy, the component renders nothing.\n\nThis component can be used to display a list of farming pools with their APR, liquidity, and rewards. It can be customized by changing the `columns` array to add or remove columns, or by changing the `Cell` property of each column to customize the rendering of each cell. It can also be styled using CSS classes or inline styles. Here is an example usage of the `FarmList` component:\n\n```jsx\nimport FarmList from './FarmList'\n\nconst pools = [\n  {\n    pair: {\n      token0: {\n        id: '0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984',\n      },\n      token1: {\n        id: '0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2',\n      },\n      name: 'UNI-ETH',\n      type: 'Sushi Farm',\n    },\n    rewards: [\n      {\n        icon: '/tokens/uni.png',\n        token: 'UNI',\n        rewardPerDay: 1000,\n      },\n      {\n        icon: '/tokens/sushi.png',\n        token: 'SUSHI',\n        rewardPerDay: 500,\n      },\n    ],\n    liquidity: 1000000,\n    apr: {\n      annual: 1000,\n      monthly: 100,\n      daily: 10,\n    },\n  },\n  // more pools...\n]\n\nfunction App() {\n  return <FarmList pools={pools} />\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What external libraries or dependencies are being used in this code?\n- The code is importing several modules from external libraries such as lodash, React, and next/image.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `FarmList` component and what props does it expect?\n- The `FarmList` component is the main component that renders a table of farming pools. It expects a prop called `pools` which is an array of objects containing information about each pool.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `Rewards` component and what props does it expect?\n- The `Rewards` component is a sub-component of `FarmList` that renders the daily rewards for each pool. It expects a prop called `rewards` which is an array of objects containing information about each reward.",
