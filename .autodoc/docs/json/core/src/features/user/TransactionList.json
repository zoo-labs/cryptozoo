  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a list of transactions. It takes in an array of transactions as a prop and maps over them to render each transaction as a separate div element. Each transaction div contains information about the tokens being traded, a link to view the transaction on the blockchain explorer, and a checkmark icon to indicate that the transaction was successful.\n\nThe component uses several other components and hooks from the project, including `Image` and `Dots` components, and the `useActiveWeb3React` and `useLingui` hooks. It also imports two icons from the `react-feather` library.\n\nThe `getExplorerLink` function is imported from a `functions/explorer` file, which is not included in this code snippet. This function likely generates a URL to view a transaction on a blockchain explorer based on the chain ID and transaction hash.\n\nThe component checks if there are any transactions to render. If there are, it maps over the transactions and renders each one as a div element. If there are no transactions, it renders a loading spinner.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that involves trading tokens on a decentralized exchange. It provides a visual representation of the user's transaction history and allows them to view the details of each transaction on the blockchain explorer. The component can be customized with different styles and icons to fit the project's design. Here is an example of how the component can be used in a parent component:\n\n```\nimport TransactionList from './TransactionList'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const transactions = [\n    {\n      tx_hash: '0x123abc',\n      token_0: {\n        logo_url: 'https://example.com/token0.png',\n        symbol: 'TOKEN0'\n      },\n      token_1: {\n        logo_url: 'https://example.com/token1.png',\n        symbol: 'TOKEN1'\n      },\n      description: 'Swapped TOKEN0 for TOKEN1'\n    },\n    // more transactions...\n  ]\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>My Transaction History</h1>\n      <TransactionList transactions={transactions} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a React component that renders a list of transactions with their corresponding token logos and descriptions.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several external libraries and components, including `react-feather`, `@lingui/macro`, `@lingui/react`, and custom functions from `../../functions/explorer` and `../../hooks/useActiveWeb3React`.\n\n3. What is the expected format of the `transactions` prop?\n- The `transactions` prop is expected to be an array of objects, where each object contains a `tx_hash` property and two nested objects with `logo_url` and `symbol` properties for each token involved in the transaction.",
