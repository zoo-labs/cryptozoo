  "summary": "The `CurrencyInputPanel` component is a React functional component that renders a panel for inputting currency amounts. It takes in three props: `field`, `meowshiState`, and `showMax`. \n\nThe `meowshiState` prop is an object that contains information about the currencies being used, as well as functions for handling input and setting the currency. The `field` prop is a string that specifies which currency field the panel is for (e.g. \"input\" or \"output\"). The `showMax` prop is a boolean that determines whether or not to show a \"Max\" button for inputting the maximum available balance.\n\nThe component renders a panel with an image of the currency, the currency symbol, an input field for entering the amount, and a display of the user's balance. The image displayed depends on the currency being used, and there is an option to switch between SUSHI and xSUSHI if the currency is SUSHI. The input field is a custom component that only allows numeric input, and the balance display shows the balance in both the currency being used and its equivalent value in USDC.\n\nThis component is likely used in a larger project that involves exchanging currencies. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting currency amounts and seeing the user's balance. The `meowshiState` object suggests that this component is part of a larger system for handling currency exchange, and the use of the `useActiveWeb3React` and `useTokenBalance` hooks suggests that this system is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport CurrencyInputPanel from \"./CurrencyInputPanel\";\n\nfunction ExchangeForm() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <CurrencyInputPanel\n        field=\"input\"\n        meowshiState={meowshiState}\n        showMax={true}\n      />\n      <CurrencyInputPanel\n        field=\"output\"\n        meowshiState={meowshiState}\n        showMax={false}\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React component called `CurrencyInputPanel` that renders a panel for inputting currency amounts and displays information about the selected currency.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several modules from external libraries, including `@zoolabs/zdk`, `next/image`, `@lingui/macro`, and `useUSDCPrice`.\n\n3. What props does the `CurrencyInputPanel` component expect?\n- The `CurrencyInputPanel` component expects three props: `field`, which specifies the currency field to which this panel corresponds; `meowshiState`, which contains information about the currencies and input fields; and `showMax`, which determines whether a \"Max\" button should be displayed to allow the user to input the maximum available balance for the selected currency.",
