  "summary": "The `HeaderToggle` component is a React functional component that renders a toggle switch with two options: \"Meow\" and \"Un-Meow\". The toggle switch is implemented using the `RadioGroup` component from the `@headlessui/react` library. \n\nThe component takes in a prop called `meowshiState`, which is an object that contains two properties: `meow` and `switchCurrencies`. `meow` is a boolean value that represents the current state of the toggle switch, and `switchCurrencies` is a function that toggles the value of `meow`. \n\nWhen the component is rendered, it displays the toggle switch with two options: \"Meow\" and \"Un-Meow\". The currently selected option is highlighted with a gradient background color. When the user clicks on one of the options, the `switchCurrencies` function is called to toggle the value of `meow`. \n\nIn addition to the toggle switch, the component also displays a text box that shows the conversion rate between xSUSHI and MEOW. The text box is styled with a gradient border and a rounded border radius. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to allow users to toggle between different modes or settings. For example, it could be used to toggle between light mode and dark mode, or between different languages. The `HeaderToggle` component can be easily customized by changing the text and styling to fit the specific needs of the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport HeaderToggle from './HeaderToggle'\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [meowshiState, setMeowshiState] = useState({ meow: true })\n\n  const handleSwitchCurrencies = () => {\n    setMeowshiState({ meow: !meowshiState.meow })\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <HeaderToggle meowshiState={meowshiState} switchCurrencies={handleSwitchCurrencies} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
