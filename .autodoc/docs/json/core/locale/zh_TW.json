  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of strings used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update. By storing all of the text in one place, it is also easier to ensure consistency in the language and terminology used throughout the project.\n\nThis code is likely used in conjunction with other code that handles the actual display of the user interface elements. For example, a button on the screen might be labeled \"Connect Wallet\", which is one of the strings in this code. The code that handles the display of the button would retrieve the \"Connect Wallet\" string from this code and use it to label the button.\n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in practice:\n\n```javascript\n// Retrieve the \"Connect Wallet\" string from the code\nconst connectWalletLabel = zoo[\"Connect Wallet\"];\n\n// Create a button element and set its label to the retrieved string\nconst connectWalletButton = document.createElement(\"button\");\nconnectWalletButton.innerText = connectWalletLabel;\n\n// Add the button to the page\ndocument.body.appendChild(connectWalletButton);\n```\n\nOverall, this code is a simple but important part of the zoo project, helping to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience for its users.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"liquidity providers\" and \"xSUSHI holders\" in some of the strings?\n- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some kind of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Expert Mode\" toggle?\n- The \"Expert Mode\" toggle likely enables advanced features such as bypassing confirmation modals and allowing high slippage trades, which may result in bad rates and lost funds. It is recommended for experienced users only.",
