  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to users throughout the application. \n\nFor example, there are strings related to adding and removing liquidity, approving transactions, and confirming swaps. There are also strings related to specific features of the zoo project, such as Animal Drops and Kashi market. \n\nThese strings are likely used in conjunction with other code to create the user interface for the zoo project. For instance, the string \"Add Liquidity\" might be used as the label for a button that allows users to add liquidity to a pool. \n\nOverall, this code is not functional on its own, but is an important part of the larger zoo project as it provides the text that users will see and interact with in the application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"liquidity providers\" and \"xSUSHI holders\" in some of the strings?\n- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some sort of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Expert Mode\" toggle?\n- The \"Expert Mode\" toggle likely enables advanced features such as bypassing confirmation modals and allowing high slippage trades, which may result in bad rates and lost funds. It is recommended for experienced users only.",
