  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update the text as needed. By storing all of the text in one place, it also ensures consistency in the language and terminology used throughout the application.\n\nFor example, the strings \"Add Liquidity\" and \"Remove Liquidity\" suggest that this code may be used in a decentralized exchange or liquidity pool platform. Other strings such as \"Stake SUSHI for xSUSHI and deposit into BentoBox in one click\" suggest that the project may involve yield farming or staking.\n\nDevelopers can use these strings in their code by referencing the appropriate key in this file. For example, if a developer wants to display the label \"Add Liquidity\" in a button, they would reference the key \"Add Liquidity\" in this file to retrieve the corresponding string.\n\nOverall, this code serves as a useful tool for managing the text used in the user interface of the zoo project, ensuring consistency and ease of maintenance.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"liquidity providers\" and \"xSUSHI holders\" in some of the strings?\n- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some sort of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Expert Mode\" toggle?\n- The \"Expert Mode\" toggle likely allows users to bypass certain confirmation prompts and enable high slippage trades, which can result in bad rates and lost funds. This feature is intended for experienced users who understand the risks involved.",
