  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to users throughout the project. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update. By storing all of the text in one place, developers can easily make changes to the wording or formatting of the interface without having to search through the entire codebase.\n\nFor example, if a developer wanted to change the label on a button from \"Add Liquidity\" to \"Provide Liquidity\", they could simply update the corresponding string in this code file rather than searching through all of the project's code files to find every instance of the label.\n\nThis code is likely used throughout the project to display text to users in various contexts, such as on buttons, in error messages, and in informational pop-ups. Developers can reference these strings in their code to display the appropriate text to users.\n\nHere is an example of how a developer might use one of these strings in their code:\n\n```\nimport zoo_strings\n\nbutton_label = zoo_strings.get(\"Add Liquidity\")\nbutton = create_button(label=button_label)\n```\n\nIn this example, the `zoo_strings` module is imported to access the \"Add Liquidity\" string. The string is then used as the label for a button that is created using a `create_button` function.\n\nOverall, this code serves an important role in the zoo project by providing a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"liquidity providers\" and \"xSUSHI holders\" in some of the strings?\n- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some kind of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Expert Mode\" toggle and what are the potential risks associated with using it?\n- The \"Expert Mode\" toggle turns off confirmation prompts and allows for high slippage trades, which can result in bad rates and lost funds. The potential risks associated with using it are not explicitly stated, but it is advised that users only use this mode if they know what they are doing.",
