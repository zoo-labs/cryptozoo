  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update. By storing all the text in one place, it is also easier to ensure consistency in the language and tone used throughout the application.\n\nFor example, the strings \"Add Liquidity\" and \"Remove Liquidity\" are likely used as labels for buttons that allow the user to add or remove liquidity from a pool. Similarly, the string \"Confirm Swap\" is likely used as the label for a button that confirms a token swap transaction.\n\nDevelopers working on the zoo project can use these strings in their code by referencing the appropriate key in this file. For example, if a developer wants to display the label \"Add Liquidity\" on a button, they can reference the key \"Add Liquidity\" in this file to retrieve the corresponding string.\n\nOverall, this code serves as a useful tool for managing the text used in the user interface of the zoo project, making it easier to maintain and update the application over time.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"liquidity providers\" and \"xSUSHI holders\" in some of the strings?\n- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some kind of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Expert Mode\" toggle?\n- The \"Expert Mode\" toggle likely enables advanced features such as bypassing confirmation modals and allowing high slippage trades, which may result in bad rates and lost funds. It is recommended that users only use this mode if they know what they are doing.",
