  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update. By storing all of the text in one place, it is also easier to ensure consistency in the language and terminology used throughout the application.\n\nFor example, the strings \"Add Liquidity\" and \"Remove Liquidity\" are likely used as labels for buttons that allow users to add or remove liquidity from a pool. Similarly, the string \"Confirm Swap\" is likely used as the label for a button that confirms a user's intention to execute a token swap.\n\nThe code also includes some informational messages, such as \"A portion of each trade (0.25%) goes to liquidity providers as a protocol incentive.\" These messages are likely displayed to the user in order to provide context and transparency about the actions they are taking within the application.\n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the zoo project's user interface, as it provides the text that is displayed to the user. By centralizing this text, the code makes it easier to manage and update the user interface, and helps ensure consistency in the language and terminology used throughout the application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"liquidity providers\" and \"xSUSHI holders\" in some of the strings?\n- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some sort of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Expert Mode\" toggle?\n- The \"Expert Mode\" toggle likely enables advanced features such as bypassing confirmation modals and allowing high slippage trades, which may result in bad rates and lost funds. It is recommended for experienced users only.",
