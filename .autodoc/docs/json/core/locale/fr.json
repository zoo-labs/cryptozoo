  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update the text as needed.\n\nFor example, the strings \"Add Liquidity\" and \"Remove Liquidity\" are likely used as button labels in a user interface for managing liquidity pools. The string \"Confirm Swap\" may be used as a button label for confirming a token swap transaction. Other strings, such as \"Loading balance\" and \"Insufficient Balance\", may be used as status messages to inform the user of the current state of their account.\n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the zoo project's user interface, as it provides the text that is displayed to the user. By keeping all of the text in one place, it makes it easier to manage and update the user interface as needed. Developers can use these strings in their code by referencing the appropriate key in the dictionary, such as `strings[\"Add Liquidity\"]`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"liquidity providers\" and \"xSUSHI holders\" in some of the strings?\n- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some kind of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Expert Mode\" toggle and what are the potential risks associated with using it?\n- The \"Expert Mode\" toggle turns off confirmation prompts and allows for high slippage trades, which can result in bad rates and lost funds. It is recommended that users only use this mode if they know what they are doing.",
