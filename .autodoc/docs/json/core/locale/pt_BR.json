  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update. By storing all the text in one place, it is also easier to ensure consistency in the language and tone used throughout the application.\n\nThis code is likely used in conjunction with other code files that handle the actual display of the user interface. For example, a JavaScript file might use these string literals to dynamically generate HTML elements with the appropriate text.\n\nHere is an example of how one of these string literals might be used in a JavaScript file:\n\n```\nconst connectWalletButton = document.createElement('button');\nconnectWalletButton.textContent = zooStrings['Connect Wallet'];\n```\n\nIn this example, a button element is created and its text content is set to the value of the 'Connect Wallet' string literal from the zooStrings object.\n\nOverall, this code is a simple but important part of the zoo project, helping to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience for its users.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"liquidity providers\" and \"xSUSHI holders\" in some of the strings?\n- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some kind of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Expert Mode\" toggle and what are the potential risks associated with using it?\n- The \"Expert Mode\" toggle likely allows users to bypass certain confirmation prompts and execute trades with higher slippage tolerance. However, the code warns that this can result in bad rates and lost funds, so users should only use it if they know what they are doing.",
