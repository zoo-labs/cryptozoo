  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update. By storing all the text in one place, it is easier to ensure consistency in the language used throughout the application. \n\nFor example, the strings \"Add Liquidity\" and \"Remove Liquidity\" are likely used as labels for buttons that allow the user to add or remove liquidity from a pool. Similarly, the string \"Confirm Swap\" is likely used as the label for a button that confirms a token swap transaction. \n\nDevelopers working on the zoo project can use these string literals in their code to display text to the user. For example, if a developer wants to display the label \"Add Liquidity\" on a button, they can reference the corresponding string literal in this file. \n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the zoo project's user interface, providing a centralized location for all the text used in the application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"0.05%\" and \"0.25%\" in the code?\n- These phrases indicate the percentage of each trade that goes to xSUSHI holders and liquidity providers, respectively, as a protocol incentive.\n\n3. What is the meaning of the term \"slippage tolerance\" in the code?\n- \"Slippage tolerance\" refers to the maximum difference between the expected price of a trade and the actual price at which the trade is executed. It is used as a parameter in the code to help prevent failed transactions due to price fluctuations.",
