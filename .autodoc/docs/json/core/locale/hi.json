  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of string values used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, button text, and error messages that are displayed to the user. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update the text as needed. By storing all of the text in one place, it also ensures consistency in the language and terminology used throughout the application.\n\nFor example, the string \"Add Liquidity\" is likely used as the label for a button that allows the user to add liquidity to a pool. Similarly, the string \"Confirm Swap\" is likely used as the label for a button that confirms a token swap transaction.\n\nDevelopers working on the zoo project can use these string values in their code by referencing the appropriate key in this file. For example, if a developer wants to display the label \"Add Liquidity\" on a button, they can reference the key \"Add Liquidity\" in this file to retrieve the corresponding string value.\n\nOverall, this code is a simple but important component of the zoo project, providing a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"liquidity providers\" and \"xSUSHI holders\" in some of the strings?\n- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some sort of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Expert Mode\" toggle?\n- The \"Expert Mode\" toggle likely enables advanced features such as bypassing confirmation modals and allowing high slippage trades, which may result in bad rates and lost funds. It is recommended for experienced users only.",
