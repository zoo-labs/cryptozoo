  "summary": "This code appears to be a collection of strings used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update the text as needed. By storing all of the text in one place, it also ensures consistency in the language and terminology used throughout the application.\n\nFor example, the code includes strings related to adding liquidity to a pool, such as \"Add Liquidity\" and \"Confirm Adding Liquidity\". It also includes strings related to swapping tokens, such as \"Confirm Swap\" and \"Slippage tolerance\". \n\nDevelopers working on the zoo project can use these strings in their code to display the appropriate text to the user. For example, they might use the string \"Add Liquidity\" as the label for a button that allows the user to add liquidity to a pool.\n\nOverall, this code is an important part of the zoo project's user interface, providing a centralized location for all of the text used in the application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.\n\n2. What is the significance of the phrases \"liquidity providers\" and \"xSUSHI holders\" in some of the strings?\n- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some sort of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the \"Expert Mode\" toggle and what are the potential risks associated with using it?\n- The \"Expert Mode\" toggle likely allows users to bypass certain confirmation prompts and execute trades with higher slippage tolerance. However, the code warns that this can result in bad rates and lost funds, so users should only use it if they know what they are doing.",
