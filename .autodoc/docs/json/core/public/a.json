  "summary": "This code is a Facebook Pixel tracking code that is used to track user behavior on a website. The Facebook Pixel is a piece of code that is placed on a website to track user activity and conversions. The code is used to track events such as page views, add to cart, purchases, and other custom events.\n\nThe code initializes the Facebook Pixel and tracks a page view event. The `fbq` function is used to call the Facebook Pixel API and pass in the event data. The `init` function initializes the Facebook Pixel with the pixel ID, which is unique to each Facebook Pixel. The `track` function is used to track a specific event, in this case, a page view event.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to track user behavior and conversions on the website. The data collected by the Facebook Pixel can be used to optimize ad campaigns, retarget users, and improve website performance. For example, if a user adds a product to their cart but does not complete the purchase, the Facebook Pixel can be used to retarget that user with ads for the product they added to their cart.\n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used in a larger project:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n\t<title>My Website</title>\n\t<!-- Facebook Pixel Code -->\n\t<script>\n\t\t!function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s)\n\t\t{if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod?\n\t\tn.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};\n\t\tif(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';\n\t\tn.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0;\n\t\tt.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];\n\t\ts.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script',\n\t\t'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/fbevents.js');\n\t\tfbq('init', '758250658033751');\n\t\tfbq('track', 'PageView');\n\t</script>\n\t<!-- End Facebook Pixel Code -->\n</head>\n<body>\n\t<h1>Welcome to my website</h1>\n\t<p>Check out our latest products!</p>\n\t<!-- Product list -->\n\t<ul>\n\t\t<li>Product 1</li>\n\t\t<li>Product 2</li>\n\t\t<li>Product 3</li>\n\t</ul>\n\t<!-- End product list -->\n\t<!-- Add to cart button -->\n\t<button onclick=\"fbq('track', 'AddToCart');\">Add to cart</button>\n\t<!-- End add to cart button -->\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this example, the Facebook Pixel code is placed in the head section of the HTML document. The `fbq` function is used to track a page view event when the page loads. The add to cart button is also tracked using the `fbq` function with the `AddToCart` event. This data can be used to retarget users who added products to their cart but did not complete the purchase.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code initializes and tracks a Facebook pixel for the zoo project's website.\n\n2. What does the `fbq` function do?\n   The `fbq` function is used to call different methods for tracking events and data with the Facebook pixel.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `async` attribute in the `t` variable?\n   The `async` attribute in the `t` variable ensures that the Facebook pixel script is loaded asynchronously, which means it won't block other resources from loading on the page.",
