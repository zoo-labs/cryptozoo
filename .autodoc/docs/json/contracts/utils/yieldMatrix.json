  "summary": "This code loads data from a Google Sheet and writes it to three JSON files: rarities.json, animals.json, and hybrids.json. The Google Sheet contains data about animals in a virtual zoo, including their rarity, yield, and parentage. \n\nThe code uses the GoogleSpreadsheet library to access the Google Sheet and the fs library to write the data to JSON files. It also imports a credentials.json file that contains authentication information for accessing the Google Sheet. \n\nThe code first loads data about the rarities of the animals from the Google Sheet. It retrieves the probability, name, yield, and boost for each rarity and stores it in an array of objects. It then writes this data to the rarities.json file. \n\nNext, the code loads data about the common animals from the Google Sheet. It retrieves the name, rarity, yield, and boost for each common animal and stores it in an array of objects. It then adds additional data to each object, including a tokenURI and metadataURI based on the animal's name, and rounds the yield to the nearest integer. Finally, it writes this data to the animals.json file. \n\nThe code then repeats this process for hybrid animals of various rarities, loading data from different sections of the Google Sheet for each rarity level. It stores the data for all hybrid animals in a single array of objects, adds tokenURI and metadataURI data to each object, and rounds the yield to the nearest integer. Finally, it writes this data to the hybrids.json file. \n\nThis code is likely part of a larger project that involves creating a virtual zoo with different types of animals. The data in the JSON files could be used to display information about the animals on a website or in an app, or to generate images or other media related to the animals. For example, the tokenURI and metadataURI data could be used to create unique images and descriptions for each animal.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code loads data from a Google Sheet containing information about rarities, animals, and yields for a project called Zoo, and then writes that data to separate JSON files.\n\n2. What dependencies does this code use?\n- This code uses the `google-spreadsheet` and `fs` packages, and imports a JSON file containing credentials.\n\n3. What data is being extracted from the Google Sheet?\n- The code extracts data about rarities, common animals, and hybrid animals of various rarities, including their names, parents, yields, and boost probabilities. This data is then processed and written to separate JSON files.",
