  "summary": "This code exports three modules from the `zoo` project: `Blockchain`, `Decimal`, and `generatedWallets`. \n\nThe `Blockchain` module likely contains code related to blockchain technology, such as creating and managing blockchain networks, transactions, and blocks. This module could be used in the larger project to enable secure and decentralized data storage and transfer.\n\nThe `Decimal` module likely contains code related to decimal arithmetic, such as performing calculations with high precision and accuracy. This module could be used in the larger project to ensure accurate financial calculations and prevent rounding errors.\n\nThe `generatedWallets` module likely contains code related to generating and managing cryptocurrency wallets. This module could be used in the larger project to enable users to securely store and manage their cryptocurrency assets.\n\nBy exporting these modules, other files in the `zoo` project can import and use their functionality. For example, a file that needs to perform decimal arithmetic could import the `Decimal` module like this:\n\n```\nimport { Decimal } from 'zoo';\n\nconst result = Decimal.add(0.1, 0.2);\nconsole.log(result); // 0.3\n```\n\nOverall, this code plays an important role in making the functionality of the `zoo` project available to other parts of the codebase.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of the `Blockchain` module?** \n   The `Blockchain` module is being exported from the `zoo` project, but without seeing the code within the module, it is unclear what functionality it provides.\n\n2. **What is the `Decimal` module used for?** \n   The `Decimal` module is being exported from the `zoo` project, but without seeing the code within the module, it is unclear what functionality it provides.\n\n3. **What is the `generatedWallets` module used for?** \n   The `generatedWallets` module is being exported from the `zoo` project, but without seeing the code within the module, it is unclear what functionality it provides.",
