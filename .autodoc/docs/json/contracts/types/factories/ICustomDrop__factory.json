  "summary": "This code defines a factory class for the ICustomDrop interface, which is used to interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The smart contract is related to a project called \"Zoo\" and is used to manage animal yields and boosts at different stages of development.\n\nThe ICustomDrop interface has a single function called \"animalStageYields\", which takes a string parameter called \"name\" and returns a tuple of three structs, each containing two uint256 values. The structs represent the yields and boosts for baby, teen, and adult animals at different stages of development. The function is non-payable, meaning it does not require any payment to be executed.\n\nThe factory class has two static methods: \"createInterface\" and \"connect\". The \"createInterface\" method returns an instance of the ICustomDrop interface, which can be used to interact with the smart contract. The \"connect\" method takes an Ethereum address and a signer or provider object as parameters and returns an instance of the ICustomDrop contract, which can be used to call the \"animalStageYields\" function and interact with the smart contract.\n\nThis code is part of a larger project called \"Zoo\" and is likely used to manage animal yields and boosts in the game. Developers working on the project can use the ICustomDrop interface and factory class to interact with the smart contract and retrieve information about animal yields and boosts at different stages of development. For example, they could call the \"animalStageYields\" function to retrieve the yields and boosts for a specific animal and use that information to update the game state.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code defines the ABI and factory for the `ICustomDrop` interface, which is used to interact with a smart contract related to a zoo.\n\n2. What is the `ICustomDrop` interface and what methods does it have?\n   \n   The `ICustomDrop` interface is not defined in this code, but it is imported from another file. This code only defines the `animalStageYields` method of the interface.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `animalStageYields` method?\n   \n   The `animalStageYields` method takes a string parameter `name` and returns a tuple of `StageYields`, which contains `YieldsBoost` tuples for the `baby`, `teen`, and `adult` stages of an animal. Each `YieldsBoost` tuple contains `yields` and `boost` values for that stage.",
