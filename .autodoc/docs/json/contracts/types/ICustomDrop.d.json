  "summary": "The code defines an interface called `ICustomDrop` that extends the `BaseContract` class. The interface has one function called `animalStageYields` that takes a string parameter called `name`. The function returns a `Promise` of a `ContractTransaction`. \n\nThe `ICustomDrop` interface is imported from a file called `common` which is not included in this code snippet. The `common` file likely contains other interfaces and types that are used throughout the project.\n\nThe `ICustomDrop` interface is used to interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The `animalStageYields` function likely queries the smart contract for information about animal yields at different stages of growth. The function returns a `Promise` of an object that contains information about the yields and boosts for baby, teen, and adult animals. \n\nThe `ethers` library is imported at the beginning of the file along with other dependencies. The `ethers` library is a popular library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain. The `BytesLike`, `Listener`, and `Provider` types are also imported from the `ethersproject` library.\n\nThe code also includes comments that indicate that the file is autogenerated and should not be edited manually. The `tslint:disable` and `eslint:disable` comments likely disable linting rules for the autogenerated code.\n\nBelow is an example of how the `animalStageYields` function might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport { ethers } from 'ethers';\nimport { ICustomDrop } from './ICustomDrop';\n\nconst provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('http://localhost:8545');\nconst contractAddress = '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890';\nconst contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, ICustomDrop.interface, provider);\n\nasync function getAnimalYields(name: string) {\n  const yields = await contract.animalStageYields(name);\n  console.log(yields);\n}\n\ngetAnimalYields('lion');\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ethers` library is used to create a provider and a contract instance. The `getAnimalYields` function calls the `animalStageYields` function on the contract instance and logs the result to the console. The `getAnimalYields` function is called with the string `'lion'` as the `name` parameter.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n- This code defines an interface for a smart contract called `ICustomDrop` that provides a function `animalStageYields` to retrieve yield and boost information for different stages of an animal. It is likely part of a larger project related to animal breeding or farming on the blockchain.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n- This code imports several modules from the `ethers` and `@ethersproject` packages, which are used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and ABI encoding/decoding.\n\n3. What are the different stages of an animal and what information is returned by `animalStageYields`?\n- The different stages of an animal are `baby`, `teen`, and `adult`, and the function returns an object containing yield and boost information for each stage. Specifically, for each stage, the function returns a tuple of two `BigNumber` values representing the yield and boost, respectively.",
