  "summary": "This code is a JSON file that contains information about the build of the project. The \"_format\" key indicates the format of the file, which is \"hh-sol-dbg-1\". The \"buildInfo\" key points to a JSON file located at \"../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json\". \n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide information about the build of the project. This information can be used to track changes and updates to the project, as well as to ensure that the project is running on the correct version. \n\nFor example, if a developer wants to check the build information of the project, they can access this JSON file and retrieve the information. They can also use this information to compare the build with previous versions of the project to identify any changes or issues. \n\nOverall, this code serves as a useful tool for managing and tracking the build of the project.",
