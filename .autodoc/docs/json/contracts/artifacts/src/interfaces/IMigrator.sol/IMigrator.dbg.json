  "summary": "This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The \"_format\" key indicates the format of the build, which is \"hh-sol-dbg-1\". The \"buildInfo\" key contains the path to the build information file, which is located at \"../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json\".\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide information about the build of the project. This information can be used to track changes and updates to the project, as well as to ensure that the project is running on the correct version of the build. \n\nFor example, if a developer wants to check the build information for the project, they can access this JSON object and retrieve the build format and path to the build information file. They can then use this information to verify that the project is running on the correct build and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.\n\nOverall, this code serves as an important component of the larger project by providing essential information about the build and ensuring that the project is running smoothly.",
