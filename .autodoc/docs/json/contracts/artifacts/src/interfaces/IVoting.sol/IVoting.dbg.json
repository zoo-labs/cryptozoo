  "summary": "This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The \"_format\" key indicates the format of the build, which is \"hh-sol-dbg-1\". The \"buildInfo\" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build date.\n\nThis code is important for tracking the version and build information of the project. It can be used to ensure that all team members are working with the same version of the code, and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development or deployment.\n\nFor example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the buildInfo file can be consulted to determine which version of the code introduced the bug. This information can then be used to roll back to a previous version of the code, or to identify the specific changes that need to be made to fix the bug.\n\nOverall, this code serves as a key piece of metadata for the project, providing important information about the build and version history. It is a critical component of any software development project, and is essential for maintaining the integrity and stability of the codebase.",
