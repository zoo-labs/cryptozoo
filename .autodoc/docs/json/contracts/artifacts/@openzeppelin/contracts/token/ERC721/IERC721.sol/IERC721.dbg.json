  "summary": "This code is a JSON file that contains information about the build of the project. The \"_format\" key specifies the format of the build, which is \"hh-sol-dbg-1\". The \"buildInfo\" key specifies the location of the build information file, which is located at \"../../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json\".\n\nThe purpose of this code is to provide information about the build of the project. This information can be used to track changes and updates to the project, as well as to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development or deployment.\n\nFor example, if a developer notices a problem with the project, they can refer to the build information file to see if any recent changes may have caused the issue. They can also use the build information to ensure that they are working with the correct version of the project.\n\nOverall, this code is a small but important part of the larger project, as it provides valuable information about the build and helps to ensure that the project is running smoothly.",
