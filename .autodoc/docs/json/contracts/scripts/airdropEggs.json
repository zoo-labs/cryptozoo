  "summary": "The code is a script that performs an airdrop of tokens to a list of addresses. The script reads a CSV file containing a list of addresses and token amounts, chunks the list into smaller pieces, and then performs an airdrop for each chunk. The script uses the ethers.js library to interact with the ZOO token contract, which is deployed on a local blockchain network.\n\nThe `chunks` function takes an array and a size parameter and returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array has a length of `size`. This function is used to split the list of addresses and token amounts into smaller chunks that can be processed more efficiently.\n\nThe `main` function is an async function that performs the airdrop. It first gets the signer object from the ethers library, which is used to sign transactions. It then gets the ZOO token contract instance using the `getContractAt` method and connects it to the signer. The script then reads the CSV file using the `fs` library and parses it using the `csv-parse` library. The resulting records are then processed in chunks using the `chunks` function.\n\nFor each chunk, the script extracts the addresses and token amounts from the records and filters out any records with a token amount of 0. It then calls the `airdrop` method on the ZOO token contract with the list of addresses and token amounts. If the airdrop is successful, the script waits for the transaction to be confirmed using the `wait` method. If the airdrop fails, the script logs an error message.\n\nFinally, the `main` function is called and the script exits with a status code of 0 if successful or 1 if there is an error.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n$ node airdrop.js\n```\n\nThis will run the script and perform the airdrop. The script assumes that there is a file called `holders.csv` in the same directory that contains the list of addresses and token amounts. The script can be modified to use a different file or to change the chunk size.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `chunks` function?\n- The `chunks` function takes an array and a size as input, and returns an array of smaller arrays, each of size `size` or smaller if the input array is not evenly divisible by `size`.\n\n2. What is the format of the input file `holders.csv`?\n- The `holders.csv` file is expected to have two columns: `address` and `amount`. Each row represents an address and the amount of tokens to be airdropped to that address.\n\n3. What happens if the amount of tokens for an address in `holders.csv` is 0?\n- If the amount of tokens for an address in `holders.csv` is 0, the address is skipped and not included in the airdrop.",
