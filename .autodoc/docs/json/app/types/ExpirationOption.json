  "summary": "This code defines a TypeScript type called `ExpirationOption`. This type is used to represent an option for an expiration date in the larger project. \n\nThe `ExpirationOption` type has four properties: `text`, `value`, `relativeTime`, and `relativeTimeUnit`. The `text` property is a string that represents the text that will be displayed for the expiration option. The `value` property is a string that represents the value that will be sent to the server when the expiration option is selected. The `relativeTime` property is a number or null that represents the relative time for the expiration option. The `relativeTimeUnit` property is a `ManipulateType` or null that represents the unit of time for the relative time.\n\nThis type can be used in the larger project to represent expiration options for various features such as subscriptions, memberships, or trial periods. For example, if the project has a subscription feature, the `ExpirationOption` type can be used to represent the different subscription plans available to the user. Each subscription plan can have its own `text`, `value`, `relativeTime`, and `relativeTimeUnit` properties.\n\nHere is an example of how the `ExpirationOption` type can be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nconst subscriptionOptions: ExpirationOption[] = [\n  {\n    text: 'Monthly Subscription',\n    value: 'monthly',\n    relativeTime: 1,\n    relativeTimeUnit: 'month'\n  },\n  {\n    text: 'Annual Subscription',\n    value: 'annual',\n    relativeTime: 1,\n    relativeTimeUnit: 'year'\n  },\n  {\n    text: 'Lifetime Subscription',\n    value: 'lifetime',\n    relativeTime: null,\n    relativeTimeUnit: null\n  }\n]\n```\n\nIn this example, an array of `ExpirationOption` objects is defined to represent the different subscription options available to the user. The first two options have a relative time of 1 month or 1 year, while the third option represents a lifetime subscription with no expiration.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ExpirationOption` type?\n   - The `ExpirationOption` type is used to represent an option for an expiration date, including its text, value, relative time, and relative time unit.\n\n2. What is the `ManipulateType` import used for?\n   - The `ManipulateType` import is used to define the type of the `relativeTimeUnit` property in the `ExpirationOption` type.\n\n3. What library is the `ManipulateType` import from?\n   - The `ManipulateType` import is from the `dayjs` library, which is likely used for working with dates and times in the project.",
