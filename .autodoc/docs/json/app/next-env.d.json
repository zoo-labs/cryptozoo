  "summary": "This file is a configuration file for the Next.js framework, which is used in the larger zoo project. The file includes two reference types, \"next\" and \"next/image-types/global\", which are used to provide type definitions for the Next.js framework and its image handling capabilities. \n\nThe purpose of this file is to ensure that the project is properly configured to use TypeScript with Next.js. The \"reference types\" statements at the top of the file allow TypeScript to understand the types used by Next.js, which helps with type checking and code completion. \n\nThe file also includes a comment stating that it should not be edited, and provides a link to the Next.js documentation for more information. This is a common practice in configuration files, as it helps prevent accidental changes that could break the project.\n\nHere is an example of how this file might be used in the larger zoo project:\n\n```typescript\nimport { GetStaticProps } from 'next';\n\ninterface Animal {\n  name: string;\n  image: string;\n}\n\ninterface Props {\n  animals: Animal[];\n}\n\nconst HomePage = ({ animals }: Props) => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo!</h1>\n      <ul>\n        {animals.map(animal => (\n          <li key={animal.name}>\n            <h2>{animal.name}</h2>\n            <img src={animal.image} alt={animal.name} />\n          </li>\n        ))}\n      </ul>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps<Props> = async () => {\n  const res = await fetch('/api/animals');\n  const animals = await res.json();\n\n  return {\n    props: {\n      animals,\n    },\n  };\n};\n\nexport default HomePage;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `GetStaticProps` function is imported from the `next` package, which is referenced in the configuration file. The `Props` interface also uses types from the `next` package. Without the reference types in the configuration file, TypeScript would not be able to understand these types and would throw errors.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the \"reference types\" comments at the top of the file?\n   - These comments are used to reference external type definitions for the Next.js framework and its image types.\n\n2. Why is there a \"NOTE\" comment stating that the file should not be edited?\n   - This comment is a warning to developers that editing this file could cause issues with the Next.js framework and its TypeScript integration.\n\n3. Where can developers find more information about using TypeScript with Next.js?\n   - The comment provides a link to the Next.js documentation, which contains more information about using TypeScript with the framework.",
