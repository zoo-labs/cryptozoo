  "summary": "The `CollectionOffer` component is a React functional component that renders a button that allows users to make an offer on a collection or attribute. The component imports several modules from different libraries, including `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`, `next/router`, `wagmi`, `swr`, `@stitches/react`, `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit`, and `context/ToastContextProvider`. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `collection`, `mutate`, `buttonCss`, and `buttonProps`. The `collection` prop is an object that contains information about the collection, such as its `id` and whether it supports bids. The `mutate` prop is a function that is called when the bid is complete. The `buttonCss` prop is an object that contains CSS styles for the button, and the `buttonProps` prop is an object that contains additional props to be passed to the button.\n\nThe component first checks whether the user is disconnected or on the wrong network. If either of these conditions is true, the button is disabled and clicking it will either switch the user to the correct network or open a connect modal. If the user is connected and on the correct network, the component checks whether the collection supports bids. If it does, the component renders a `BidModal` component from `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui` that allows the user to make a bid on the collection or attribute. \n\nThe `BidModal` component takes in several props, including `collectionId`, `trigger`, `attribute`, `onClose`, and `onBidError`. The `collectionId` prop is the ID of the collection that the user is bidding on. The `trigger` prop is the button that triggers the `BidModal`. The `attribute` prop is an object that contains information about the attribute that the user is bidding on. The `onClose` prop is a function that is called when the `BidModal` is closed, and the `onBidError` prop is a function that is called when there is an error placing the bid.\n\nOverall, the `CollectionOffer` component provides a simple way for users to make bids on collections or attributes, and it integrates with several different libraries to provide a seamless user experience.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   \n   This code defines a React functional component called `CollectionOffer` that renders a button which opens a bid modal for a given collection. It also handles some logic related to the attribute modal and network connectivity.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n   \n   This code imports several modules from external packages such as `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`, `next/router`, `react`, `wagmi`, `swr`, `@stitches/react`, and `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit`. It also imports a local component called `Button` and a context called `ToastContext`.\n\n3. What are the props accepted by the `CollectionOffer` component?\n   \n   The `CollectionOffer` component accepts three props: `collection`, `mutate`, `buttonCss`, and `buttonProps`. `collection` is an object that contains information about the collection being bid on. `mutate` is a function that can be called to trigger a revalidation of the data. `buttonCss` is a CSS object that can be used to style the button. `buttonProps` is an object that contains additional props to be passed to the button component.",
