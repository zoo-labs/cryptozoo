  "summary": "The `BuyNow` component is a React functional component that provides a button to buy a token on a marketplace. It is designed to be used in a larger project that involves buying and selling tokens on a blockchain-based marketplace. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `tokenId`, `collectionId`, `orderId`, `buttonCss`, `buttonProps`, `buttonChildren`, and `mutate`. These props are used to configure the component and customize its appearance. \n\nThe component uses several hooks from various libraries, including `useSigner` and `useNetwork` from `wagmi`, `useConnectModal` from `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit`, and `useMarketplaceChain` from `hooks`. These hooks are used to retrieve information about the user's account, the current network, and the marketplace chain. \n\nThe component checks whether the user is connected to the correct network and whether they have the necessary permissions to buy the token. If the user is not connected to the correct network, the component prompts them to switch to the correct network. If the user is not connected to their wallet, the component prompts them to connect their wallet. \n\nIf the user has the necessary permissions to buy the token, the component displays a `BuyModal` component from `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`. This modal provides a form for the user to enter the details of their purchase, including the token ID, collection ID, and order ID. \n\nIf the user does not have the necessary permissions to buy the token, the component displays a regular `Button` component from `components/primitives`. This button prompts the user to connect their wallet or switch to the correct network. \n\nOverall, the `BuyNow` component provides a simple and customizable way for users to buy tokens on a blockchain-based marketplace. It handles network and wallet connectivity issues and provides a user-friendly interface for purchasing tokens. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport BuyNow from 'zoo/BuyNow'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <BuyNow \n        tokenId=\"123\"\n        collectionId=\"456\"\n        buttonChildren=\"Buy Now\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
