  "summary": "The `Bid` component is a React functional component that renders a button that triggers a modal for making an offer on a token. The component takes in several props, including `tokenId`, `collectionId`, `disabled`, `openState`, `buttonCss`, `buttonProps`, and `mutate`. \n\nThe `Bid` component uses several hooks, including `useAccount`, `useConnectModal`, `useMarketplaceChain`, `useNetwork`, `useSigner`, and `useSwitchNetwork`. These hooks are used to retrieve information about the user's account, the marketplace chain, the network, and the signer. \n\nThe `trigger` variable is a `Button` component that is rendered with the `buttonCss` and `buttonProps` props passed in. If the user is disconnected or on the wrong network, the `trigger` button is cloned and an `onClick` function is added to it. This function checks if the user is on the correct network and prompts them to connect their wallet if they are not connected. If the user is on the correct network, the function switches the user to the marketplace chain. \n\nIf the user is connected and on the correct network, the `BidModal` component is rendered. This component takes in several props, including `tokenId`, `collectionId`, `trigger`, `openState`, `onClose`, and `onBidError`. The `trigger` prop is the `trigger` button that was previously defined. The `onClose` prop is a function that is called when the modal is closed. If the `mutate` prop is defined and the current step is `BidStep.Complete`, the `mutate` function is called. The `onBidError` prop is a function that is called when there is an error placing a bid. If the error is caused by the user canceling the transaction, a toast notification is displayed. Otherwise, a toast notification is displayed indicating that the transaction was not completed. \n\nOverall, the `Bid` component is used to render a button that triggers a modal for making an offer on a token. The component handles checking if the user is connected and on the correct network, and prompts the user to connect their wallet or switch networks if necessary. The component also handles displaying toast notifications when there are errors placing a bid.",
