  "summary": "The `AcceptBid` component is a React functional component that renders a button that triggers an `AcceptBidModal` component. The `AcceptBidModal` component is imported from the `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui` library. \n\nThe `AcceptBid` component takes in several props, including `tokenId`, `bidId`, `collectionId`, `disabled`, `openState`, `buttonCss`, `buttonChildren`, `buttonProps`, and `mutate`. These props are used to configure the `AcceptBidModal` component and the `Button` component that is rendered by the `AcceptBid` component.\n\nThe `AcceptBid` component uses several hooks from various libraries, including `useAccount`, `useConnectModal`, `useNetwork`, `useSigner`, `useSwitchNetwork`, and `useMarketplaceChain`. These hooks are used to retrieve information about the user's account, the current network, and the marketplace chain. \n\nIf the user is not connected to a wallet or is on the wrong network, the `AcceptBid` component will render a disabled button that, when clicked, will either prompt the user to connect their wallet or switch to the correct network. If the user is connected to a wallet and is on the correct network, the `AcceptBid` component will render an enabled button that, when clicked, will trigger the `AcceptBidModal` component.\n\nThe `AcceptBidModal` component is a modal that displays information about the bid that the user is accepting. It takes in several props, including `trigger`, `openState`, `bidId`, `collectionId`, `tokenId`, `onClose`, and `onBidAcceptError`. These props are used to configure the modal and handle events that occur when the modal is closed or an error occurs.\n\nWhen the `AcceptBidModal` component is closed, the `onClose` function is called. If the `mutate` prop is provided and the current step is `AcceptBidStep.Complete`, the `mutate` function is called. If an error occurs when accepting the bid, the `onBidAcceptError` function is called. If the error is a \"price mismatch\" error, a toast notification is displayed to the user. If the error is a user rejection error, another toast notification is displayed to the user. If the error is any other type of error, a generic toast notification is displayed to the user.\n\nOverall, the `AcceptBid` component is a reusable component that can be used to accept bids in a marketplace. It handles user authentication, network switching, and error handling, making it easy for developers to integrate into their projects.",
