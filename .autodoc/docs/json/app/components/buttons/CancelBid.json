  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `CancelBid` that allows users to cancel a bid on a marketplace. The component takes in several props, including the `bidId` of the bid to cancel, a `trigger` element that will be used to open the cancel bid modal, and an optional `mutate` function that will be called after the bid is canceled.\n\nThe component first checks if the user is on the correct network for the marketplace. If not, it will display the `trigger` element and prompt the user to switch to the correct network or connect their wallet if they haven't already. If the user is on the correct network, the component will render a `CancelBidModal` from the `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui` library. This modal will display information about the bid being canceled and allow the user to confirm the cancellation.\n\nThe `CancelBidModal` component takes in several props, including the `bidId`, `trigger`, and `openState` props passed down from the `CancelBid` component. It also takes in two callback functions, `onCancelComplete` and `onCancelError`, which will be called after the bid is canceled successfully or unsuccessfully, respectively. Finally, it takes in an `onClose` callback function that will be called when the modal is closed, which will call the `mutate` function if it was passed in as a prop and the cancellation was successful.\n\nOverall, this component provides a simple way for users to cancel bids on a marketplace, handling network switching and wallet connection automatically. It can be used in conjunction with other components and functions in the larger project to provide a complete marketplace experience for users. For example, it could be used alongside a component that displays a user's active bids and allows them to cancel them directly from the page.",
