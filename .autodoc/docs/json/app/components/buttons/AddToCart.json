  "summary": "The `AddToCart` component is a React functional component that provides a button to add an item to the shopping cart. It is designed to be used in an e-commerce application and is part of the larger `zoo` project. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `token`, `orderId`, `buttonCss`, and `buttonProps`. The `token` prop is an object that represents the item being added to the cart. The `orderId` prop is used to identify an item that has already been added to the cart. The `buttonCss` prop is used to apply custom CSS styles to the button, and the `buttonProps` prop is used to pass additional props to the button component.\n\nThe component uses several hooks to interact with the shopping cart and the user's account. The `useCart` hook is used to get the current state of the shopping cart, including the items in the cart and the chain that the cart is associated with. The `useAccount` hook is used to check if the user is connected to an Ethereum wallet. The `useConnectModal` hook is used to open a modal that prompts the user to connect their wallet if they are not already connected. The `useMarketplaceChain` hook is used to get the chain that the marketplace is running on.\n\nThe component renders a button that displays a shopping cart icon. If the `orderId` prop is provided, the button will either add or remove the item with the corresponding order ID from the cart. If the item is already in the cart, the button will display a minus icon, and clicking the button will remove the item from the cart. If the item is not in the cart, the button will display a shopping cart icon, and clicking the button will add the item to the cart.\n\nIf the `orderId` prop is not provided, the component will use the `token` prop to add or remove an item from the cart. If the item is already in the cart, the button will display a minus icon, and clicking the button will remove the item from the cart. If the item is not in the cart, the button will display a shopping cart icon, and clicking the button will add the item to the cart.\n\nIf the chain associated with the cart is different from the marketplace chain, the component will display a confirmation modal that prompts the user to clear their cart and start a new one. If the user confirms, the cart will be cleared, and the item will be added to the cart on the marketplace chain.\n\nOverall, the `AddToCart` component provides a simple way to add items to the shopping cart in an e-commerce application. It handles the logic of adding and removing items from the cart and provides a user-friendly interface for the user to interact with.",
