  "summary": "The `EditListing` component is a React functional component that provides a button to edit a listing. It takes in several props, including `listingId`, `tokenId`, `collectionId`, `disabled`, `openState`, `buttonCss`, `buttonProps`, `buttonChildren`, and `mutate`. \n\nThe component first imports several dependencies, including `useConnectModal` from `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit`, `Button` from `components/primitives`, `ToastContext` from `context/ToastContextProvider`, `useMarketplaceChain` from `hooks`, `useAccount`, `useNetwork`, `useSigner`, and `useSwitchNetwork` from `wagmi`, `CSS` from `@stitches/react`, and `EditListingModal` and `EditListingStep` from `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`.\n\nThe component then defines a `Props` type that specifies the types of the props that the component takes in. The component itself takes in these props and destructures them. \n\nThe component then uses several hooks to get information about the user's account, network, and signer. It also checks whether the user is in the correct network and whether the user is disconnected. \n\nThe component then creates a `trigger` button using the `Button` component and the `buttonCss`, `buttonProps`, and `buttonChildren` props. If the user is disconnected or in the wrong network, the component returns a clone of the `trigger` button with an `onClick` function that switches the user to the correct network and opens the connect modal if the user is not connected. If the user is connected and in the correct network, the component returns an `EditListingModal` component with the `trigger` button as a prop. \n\nThe `EditListingModal` component is a modal that allows the user to edit a listing. It takes in several props, including `trigger`, `openState`, `listingId`, `tokenId`, `collectionId`, `onClose`, and `onEditListingError`. \n\nOverall, the `EditListing` component provides a button that allows the user to edit a listing and handles network and connection issues. It can be used in a larger project that involves editing listings. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<EditListing\n  listingId=\"123\"\n  tokenId=\"456\"\n  collectionId=\"789\"\n  buttonChildren=\"Edit Listing\"\n/>\n```",

What props can be passed to the `EditListing` component?\n   - The `EditListing` component accepts several optional props, including `listingId`, `tokenId`, `collectionId`, `disabled`, `openState`, `buttonCss`, `buttonProps`, `buttonChildren`, and `mutate`. These props are used to customize the behavior and appearance of the component.",
