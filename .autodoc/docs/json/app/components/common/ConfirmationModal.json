  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `ConfirmationModal` that renders a dialog box with a title, message, and two buttons: one for confirming an action and one for canceling it. The purpose of this component is to provide a reusable way to display a confirmation prompt to the user and handle their response.\n\nThe component takes several props, including the `title` and `message` to display in the dialog, the `confirmationText` to display on the confirmation button (defaulting to \"Continue\"), and functions to handle the `open` state of the dialog and the user's response (`onOpenChange` and `onConfirmed`, respectively).\n\nThe component uses the `Dialog` component from a custom `components/primitives` library to render the dialog box, and the `Box`, `Button`, `Flex`, and `Text` components from the same library to style its contents. It also uses the `@radix-ui/react-dialog` library to manage the dialog's open state and provide accessibility features.\n\nWhen the user clicks the confirmation button, the `onConfirmed` function is called with a `true` argument, and the `onOpenChange` function is called with a `false` argument to close the dialog. When the user clicks the cancel button, the `onConfirmed` function is called with a `false` argument, and the `onOpenChange` function is again called with a `false` argument to close the dialog.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project whenever a confirmation prompt is needed, such as when deleting an item or submitting a form. It provides a consistent and accessible way to handle user confirmation, and can be easily customized with different titles, messages, and confirmation button text. Here is an example of how the component might be used:\n\n```\nimport { useState } from 'react'\nimport { ConfirmationModal } from 'components/ConfirmationModal'\n\nexport const DeleteButton = () => {\n  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false)\n\n  const handleDelete = () => {\n    // perform delete action\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Delete</button>\n      <ConfirmationModal\n        title=\"Are you sure?\"\n        message=\"This action cannot be undone.\"\n        onConfirmed={handleDelete}\n        open={open}\n        onOpenChange={setOpen}\n      />\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React component called `ConfirmationModal` that renders a dialog box with a title, message, and two buttons for confirming or canceling an action.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n- This code imports several modules from external libraries, including `react`, `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, and custom components from a `components/primitives` directory.\n\n3. What props can be passed to the `ConfirmationModal` component?\n- The `ConfirmationModal` component accepts several props, including `title`, `message`, `confirmationText`, `open`, `onOpenChange`, and `onConfirmed`. These props control the content and behavior of the dialog box.",
