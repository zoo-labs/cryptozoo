  "summary": "The code above defines a React functional component called `ConnectWalletButton`. This component renders a custom button that allows users to connect their wallet to the application. The button is implemented using the `ConnectButton` component from the `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` library.\n\nThe `ConnectWalletButton` component takes no props and returns a JSX element that renders the `ConnectButton.Custom` component. This component takes a function as a child that receives an object with four properties: `account`, `chain`, `openConnectModal`, and `mounted`. These properties are used to determine whether the user's wallet is connected and whether the button should be rendered.\n\nIf the `mounted`, `account`, and `chain` properties are all truthy, the component returns `null`, which means that the button is not rendered. Otherwise, the component returns a `Button` component from the `components/primitives/Button` module. This button has the text \"Connect Wallet\" and an `onClick` handler that calls the `openConnectModal` function when clicked.\n\nThe `ConnectWalletButton` component is likely used in a larger application that requires users to connect their wallets to interact with the blockchain. This component provides a simple and customizable way to implement a wallet connection button that can be styled and positioned as needed. Here is an example of how the `ConnectWalletButton` component can be used in a React application:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport ConnectWalletButton from './ConnectWalletButton';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>\n      <ConnectWalletButton />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```",

What is the purpose of the `ConnectWalletButton` component?\n- The `ConnectWalletButton` component is a functional component that renders a custom connect wallet button using the `ConnectButton` component.\n\n3. What happens when the `ConnectWalletButton` is clicked?\n- When the `ConnectWalletButton` is clicked, it opens a connect modal if the `mounted`, `account`, and `chain` variables are truthy. If any of these variables are falsy, the button does not do anything.",
