  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `Head` that renders the `<head>` section of an HTML page. This section includes meta tags, title, and favicon. The component takes in three optional props: `ogImage`, `title`, and `description`. \n\nThe purpose of this component is to provide a way to easily configure the meta tags and title of an HTML page, which is important for search engine optimization (SEO) and social media sharing. The `ogImage` prop specifies the URL of the Open Graph image to be displayed in social media shares, while the `title` and `description` props specify the title and description of the page, respectively. \n\nThe component uses the `NextHead` component from the `next/head` package to render the `<head>` section. It then sets the `<title>` tag to the value of the `title` prop and the `<meta>` tag with the `name` attribute set to `\"description\"` to the value of the `description` prop. \n\nAdditionally, the component sets several `<meta>` tags for Twitter and Open Graph. These tags provide information about the page that can be used by social media platforms when the page is shared. For example, the `twitter:image` tag specifies the image to be displayed when the page is shared on Twitter, while the `og:image` tag specifies the image to be displayed when the page is shared on other platforms that support Open Graph. \n\nOverall, this component is a useful tool for configuring the meta tags and title of an HTML page, which can help improve SEO and social media sharing. Here's an example of how the component might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport { Head } from 'zoo'\n\nfunction MyPage() {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Head\n        title=\"My Page | Zoo\"\n        description=\"This is my awesome page!\"\n        ogImage=\"https://example.com/my-image.png\"\n      />\n      <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```",
