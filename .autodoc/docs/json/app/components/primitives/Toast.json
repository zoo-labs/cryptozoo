  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `Toast` that renders a notification message. The component is designed to be used in conjunction with a `ToastContextProvider` context provider, which manages a list of toasts to be displayed. \n\nThe `Toast` component uses the `@radix-ui/react-toast` library to render the notification message. It defines a `ToastRoot` styled component that sets the appearance of the notification message, including its background color, border radius, and padding. The `ToastRoot` component also defines several CSS animations that control how the notification message appears and disappears from the screen. \n\nThe `Toast` component takes several props that determine the content and appearance of the notification message. These include `title`, `description`, `action`, and `status`. The `title` and `description` props are used to set the text content of the notification message. The `action` prop is used to render a clickable button or link within the notification message. The `status` prop is used to set the color of a circle icon that appears next to the notification message. If `status` is set to `'success'`, the icon is green; if it is set to `'error'`, the icon is red. \n\nWhen a `Toast` component is rendered, it adds itself to the list of toasts managed by the `ToastContextProvider`. When the notification message is closed, either by the user clicking the action button or by the notification message disappearing due to a timeout or animation, the `Toast` component removes itself from the list of toasts. \n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable and customizable way to display notification messages to users in a React application. Here is an example of how the `Toast` component might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport { ToastProvider } from 'context/ToastContextProvider'\nimport Toast from './Toast'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <ToastProvider>\n      <div>\n        <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>\n        <button onClick={() => showToast()}>Show toast</button>\n      </div>\n    </ToastProvider>\n  )\n\n  function showToast() {\n    const id = Date.now().toString()\n    const title = 'Hello, world!'\n    const description = 'This is a notification message.'\n    const action = <button onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>Click me</button>\n    const status = 'success'\n    const toast = { id, title, description, action, status }\n    setToasts((toasts) => [...toasts, toast])\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ToastProvider` context provider is used to manage the list of toasts. When the user clicks the \"Show toast\" button, a new `Toast` component is added to the list of toasts with the specified `title`, `description`, `action`, and `status`. The `Toast` component is then rendered on the screen, and the user can interact with it as desired.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Toast` component?\n   - The `Toast` component is used to display toast notifications with a title, description, and optional action and status.\n\n2. What is the role of the `ToastContext` and how is it used in this code?\n   - The `ToastContext` is used to manage the state of the toasts being displayed. It is used to add and remove toasts from the list of toasts.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `swipeOut` and `hide` keyframes?\n   - The `swipeOut` keyframe is used to animate the toast out of view when it is swiped away. The `hide` keyframe is used to animate the toast out of view when it is closed.",
