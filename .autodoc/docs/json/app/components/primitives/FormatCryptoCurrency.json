  "summary": "The `FormatCryptoCurrency` module is a React component that formats and displays cryptocurrency values with an associated icon. It imports the `FormatCrypto` and `CryptoCurrencyIcon` components from other files in the `zoo` project. \n\nThe `FormatCryptoCurrency` component takes in several props, including `amount`, `address`, `maximumFractionDigits`, `logoHeight`, `textStyle`, `css`, and `decimals`. The `amount` prop is the value of the cryptocurrency to be formatted and displayed. The `address` prop is an optional string that represents the address of the cryptocurrency. The `maximumFractionDigits` prop is an optional number that specifies the maximum number of decimal places to display. The `logoHeight` prop is an optional number that specifies the height of the associated cryptocurrency icon. The `textStyle` and `css` props are optional objects that allow for custom styling of the formatted text and icon, respectively. The `decimals` prop is an optional number that specifies the number of decimal places to display.\n\nThe `FormatCryptoCurrency` component renders the `FormatCrypto` component with the `amount`, `maximumFractionDigits`, and `decimals` props passed in. It also renders the `CryptoCurrencyIcon` component with the `logoHeight` and `address` props passed in. The `CryptoCurrencyIcon` component displays the icon associated with the specified cryptocurrency address.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger `zoo` project to display cryptocurrency values with their associated icons in a consistent and formatted manner. For example, it could be used in a wallet or portfolio view to display the current value of various cryptocurrencies. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport FormatCryptoCurrency from './FormatCryptoCurrency'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <FormatCryptoCurrency amount={0.123456789} address=\"0x123abc\" />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
