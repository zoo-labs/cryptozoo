  "summary": "This code defines a set of CSS properties for creating flexible layouts using the `styled` function from the `stitches.config` library and the `motion` library from `framer-motion`. The `flexCss` object contains a set of CSS properties for creating flexible layouts using the `display: flex` property. The `variants` object contains a set of properties for aligning and justifying items within the layout, setting the direction of the layout, and wrapping items within the layout. \n\nThe `styled` function is used to create a new styled component that extends the `div` element and applies the `flexCss` object as its styles. This component can be used to create flexible layouts by applying the `align`, `justify`, `direction`, and `wrap` variants to its children. \n\nAdditionally, the code exports a new component called `AnimatedFlex` that extends the `motion.div` element and applies the same `flexCss` object as its styles. This component can be used to create animated flexible layouts using the `framer-motion` library. \n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to create flexible layouts using CSS properties and can be used throughout the larger project to create consistent and responsive designs. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport Flex from './Flex'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <Flex align=\"center\" justify=\"center\" direction=\"column\">\n      <h1>Hello World</h1>\n      <p>This is a flexible layout</p>\n    </Flex>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `motion` and `stitches.config` imports?\n   - The `motion` import is from the `framer-motion` library and is likely used for animating components. The `styled` import is from the `stitches.config` file and is likely used for styling components with CSS-in-JS.\n2. What is the `flexCss` object used for?\n   - The `flexCss` object defines variants for different flexbox properties such as `align-items`, `justify-content`, `flex-direction`, and `flex-wrap`. It is likely used to easily apply these variants to styled components.\n3. What is the purpose of the `AnimatedFlex` export?\n   - The `AnimatedFlex` export is a styled component that extends the `motion.div` component and applies the `flexCss` object to it. This allows for the component to be animated and styled with flexbox properties.",
