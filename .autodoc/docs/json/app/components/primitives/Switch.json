  "summary": "This code defines a custom switch component using the Stitches and Radix UI libraries. The switch component is a toggle button that can be either on or off. The purpose of this code is to create a switch component that can be used in the larger project, likely as a user interface element for toggling settings or options.\n\nThe code imports the necessary libraries and defines a `StyledSwitch` component using the `styled` function from Stitches. The `StyledSwitch` component is based on the `SwitchPrimitive.Root` component from Radix UI and has several CSS styles applied to it. These styles define the appearance of the switch, including its size, background color, border radius, and transition effects. The `$$focusColor` variable is used to define the color of the switch when it is in focus.\n\nThe `Thumb` component is also defined using the `styled` function and is based on the `SwitchPrimitive.Thumb` component from Radix UI. The `Thumb` component defines the appearance of the switch's thumb, which is the small circle that moves back and forth when the switch is toggled. The `Thumb` component has several CSS styles applied to it, including its size, background color, border radius, and transition effects. The `$$borderColor` variable is used to define the color of the switch's border.\n\nFinally, the `Switch` component is defined as a function that takes an optional `props` object and returns the `StyledSwitch` component with a `Thumb` component nested inside it. This `Switch` component can be used in the larger project to create switch elements that have the custom styles defined in this code.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport Switch from './Switch'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false)\n\n  function handleToggle() {\n    setIsChecked(!isChecked)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Switch checked={isChecked} onChange={handleToggle} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Switch` component is imported from the file containing the code above and used in a `MyComponent` function. The `MyComponent` function uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the switch, and the `handleToggle` function is called when the switch is toggled. The `Switch` component is rendered with the `checked` prop set to the current state of the switch and the `onChange` prop set to the `handleToggle` function.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a custom switch component using the `@stitches/react` and `@radix-ui/react-switch` libraries.\n\n2. What are the styles applied to the switch and its thumb?\n   The switch has a width of 46, height of 24, gray background color, and a primary color when checked. The thumb has a width and height of 20, white background color, gray border color, and moves to the right when checked.\n\n3. What are the props that can be passed to the `Switch` component?\n   The `Switch` component accepts optional props of type `SwitchPrimitive.SwitchProps`, which can be used to customize the behavior of the switch component.",
