  "summary": "This code defines and exports three styled components for use in a larger project called \"zoo\". The components are based on the TabsPrimitive components from the \"@radix-ui/react-tabs\" library. \n\nThe first component, TabsList, is a styled version of the TabsPrimitive.List component. It sets the display to flex, adds a gap of $5 (a custom variable defined elsewhere in the project), and adds a bottom border of 1px solid $gray5 (another custom variable). It also adds margin-top and margin-bottom of $5 and $4 respectively. This component could be used to display a list of tabs in a horizontal row with some spacing between them.\n\nThe second component, TabsTrigger, is a styled version of the TabsPrimitive.Trigger component. It sets the font weight to 700 and adds padding-bottom of $3 (another custom variable). It also adds a box shadow when the data-state is \"active\". This component could be used to style the clickable element that activates a particular tab.\n\nThe third component, TabsContent, is a styled version of the TabsPrimitive.Content component. It does not have any additional styles beyond what is provided by the TabsPrimitive component. This component could be used to style the content that is displayed when a particular tab is active.\n\nOverall, these styled components provide a way to customize the appearance of the TabsPrimitive components from the \"@radix-ui/react-tabs\" library for use in the larger \"zoo\" project. By defining these components with specific styles, the project can maintain a consistent look and feel across all instances of tabs and their associated content. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { TabsList, TabsTrigger, TabsContent } from 'zoo'\n\n<TabsList>\n  <TabsTrigger>Tab 1</TabsTrigger>\n  <TabsTrigger>Tab 2</TabsTrigger>\n  <TabsTrigger>Tab 3</TabsTrigger>\n</TabsList>\n\n<TabsContent>\n  <p>Content for Tab 1</p>\n</TabsContent>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What library is being used for the Tabs component?\n   - The Tabs component is being imported from the `@radix-ui/react-tabs` library.\n\n2. What styling library is being used to style the Tabs component?\n   - The Tabs component is being styled using the `stitches.config` styling library.\n\n3. What are the styled components being exported from this file?\n   - The file is exporting three styled components: `TabsList`, `TabsTrigger`, and `TabsContent`.",
