  "summary": "The code above is a React component that exports a functional component called `Value`. This component is used to display a value with an accompanying icon. The component takes in four props: `type`, `value`, `size`, and `fontSize`. \n\nThe `type` prop is used to determine which icon to display. If `type` is equal to `\"weth\"`, the component will display an icon of the WETH token. Otherwise, it will display an icon of the ETH token. \n\nThe `value` prop is the value that will be displayed alongside the icon. If `value` is not provided, the component will display three dashes (`---`) instead. \n\nThe `size` prop determines the size of the icon. The default size is 11. \n\nThe `fontSize` prop determines the font size of the value displayed alongside the icon. The default font size is 16. \n\nThe component is built using other components from the same project, including `Flex`, `Box`, and `Text`. These components are imported at the top of the file using the `import` statement. \n\nThis component can be used in various parts of the project where a value needs to be displayed with an accompanying icon. For example, it could be used in a table to display the balance of a user's WETH or ETH tokens. \n\nHere is an example of how the `Value` component could be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport Value from \"./Value\";\n\nconst TokenBalance = ({ token, balance }) => (\n  <div>\n    <Value type={token} value={balance} />\n  </div>\n);\n```\n\nIn this example, the `TokenBalance` component takes in two props: `token` and `balance`. The `Value` component is used to display the `balance` prop with an icon of the `token` prop.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Value` component?\n   The `Value` component is used to display a value with an accompanying icon, and it takes in props such as `type`, `value`, `size`, and `fontSize`.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `false && <Text css={{ fontFamily: \"arial\" }}>Îž</Text>` line?\n   This line is currently commented out with `false &&`, so it does not render anything. However, it appears to be intended to render a Greek letter \"Xi\" symbol using the Arial font.\n\n3. Where are the image files for the `weth` and `eth` icons located?\n   The image files for the `weth` and `eth` icons are located in the root directory of the project and are named `weth.png` and `eth.png`, respectively.",
