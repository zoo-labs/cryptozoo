  "summary": "The code defines a custom tooltip component that can be used in the larger project. The tooltip component is built using the `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` and `@radix-ui/react-popover` libraries. The component is responsive and adjusts its behavior based on the device size. \n\nThe `Tooltip` component takes in several props including `children`, `content`, `open`, `defaultOpen`, and `onOpenChange`. The `children` prop is the element that the tooltip is attached to. The `content` prop is the text or element that is displayed in the tooltip. The `open` prop is a boolean that determines whether the tooltip is currently open. The `defaultOpen` prop is a boolean that determines whether the tooltip is open by default. The `onOpenChange` prop is a function that is called when the tooltip is opened or closed.\n\nThe `Tooltip` component checks whether the device is small (max width of 600px) and if it is, it renders a `Popover` component instead of a `TooltipPrimitive` component. The `Popover` component is used to display the tooltip on small devices because it provides better accessibility and usability on touch devices. The `TooltipPrimitive` component is used on larger devices because it provides a more traditional tooltip experience.\n\nBoth the `Popover` and `TooltipPrimitive` components contain an arrow and a box that wraps the content. The arrow is styled using the `TooltipArrow` and `PopoverArrow` components respectively. The box is styled using the `Box` component from the `stitches.config` file. \n\nHere is an example of how the `Tooltip` component can be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport Tooltip from './Tooltip'\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Tooltip content=\"Hello World!\">\n        <button>Hover me</button>\n      </Tooltip>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis code will render a button with a tooltip that says \"Hello World!\" when the button is hovered over. The tooltip will adjust its behavior based on the device size.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Tooltip` component?\n- The `Tooltip` component is used to render a tooltip with customizable content and styling.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this file?\n- This file depends on several external packages, including `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`, `@radix-ui/react-popover`, `react-responsive`, and `hooks`. It also imports a `Box` component and uses the `styled` function from `stitches.config`.\n\n3. What is the difference between the `Popover` and `TooltipPrimitive` components?\n- The `Popover` component is used when the device width is less than or equal to 600 pixels, while the `TooltipPrimitive` component is used for larger devices. The `Popover` component also includes a trigger element and additional positioning and alignment props.",
