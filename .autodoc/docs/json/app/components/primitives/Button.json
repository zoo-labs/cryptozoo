  "summary": "The code defines a reusable Button component using the Stitches CSS-in-JS library. The component is styled with various CSS properties and variants to allow for customization. The purpose of this code is to provide a consistent and flexible way to create buttons throughout the project.\n\nThe Button component is created using the `styled` function from the Stitches library. It takes two arguments: the HTML element to be styled (in this case, a button), and an object containing the CSS properties and variants for the component.\n\nThe CSS properties include styles for the button's font, background color, border radius, and more. The `variants` object allows for customization of the button's color, corner style, and size. For example, the `color` variant has options for primary, secondary, gray3, gray4, and ghost. The `corners` variant has options for square, rounded, pill, and circle. The `size` variant has options for none, xs, small, medium, and large.\n\nThe `compoundVariants` array allows for even more customization by combining variants. For example, there are compound variants for circle buttons with different sizes.\n\nThe `defaultVariants` object sets the default values for the button's variants. In this case, the default color is primary, the default corner style is rounded, and the default size is medium.\n\nThe Button component is exported as the default export of the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example:\n\n```\nimport Button from 'zoo/Button'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Button color=\"secondary\" corners=\"pill\" size=\"large\">\n      Click me!\n    </Button>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis code imports the Button component from the `zoo/Button` module and uses it with custom variants to create a large, pill-shaped, secondary-colored button with the text \"Click me!\".",
