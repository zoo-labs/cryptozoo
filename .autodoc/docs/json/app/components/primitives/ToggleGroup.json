  "summary": "This code defines and exports styled components for a toggle group UI element using the `@radix-ui/react-toggle-group` library. The `ToggleGroup` component is a container for `ToggleGroupItem` components, which represent individual toggle buttons. \n\nThe `StyledToggleGroupRoot` component is a styled version of the `ToggleGroupRoot` component from the `@radix-ui/react-toggle-group` library. It sets styles for the container element, including a border radius, overflow, display, and gap. \n\nThe `StyledToggleGroupItem` component is a styled version of the `ToggleGroupItem` component from the `@radix-ui/react-toggle-group` library. It sets styles for the individual toggle buttons, including a background color, text color, and padding. It also sets a different background color for the toggle button when it is in the \"on\" state. \n\nThese styled components can be used in the larger project to create a toggle group UI element with a custom look and feel. For example, the `ToggleGroup` component can be used as a container for multiple `ToggleGroupItem` components, which can be styled differently based on their state. \n\nHere is an example of how these components can be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { ToggleGroup, ToggleGroupItem } from 'zoo'\n\nfunction MyToggleGroup() {\n  return (\n    <ToggleGroup>\n      <ToggleGroupItem>Option 1</ToggleGroupItem>\n      <ToggleGroupItem>Option 2</ToggleGroupItem>\n      <ToggleGroupItem>Option 3</ToggleGroupItem>\n    </ToggleGroup>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis code creates a `ToggleGroup` component with three `ToggleGroupItem` components inside. The `ToggleGroupItem` components will have the styles defined in the `StyledToggleGroupItem` component, and the `ToggleGroup` component will have the styles defined in the `StyledToggleGroupRoot` component.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?\n   This code defines styled components for a toggle group UI element using the Radix UI library. It solves the problem of creating a customizable toggle group component with consistent styling.\n\n2. What are the specific styles applied to the `StyledToggleGroupRoot` and `StyledToggleGroupItem` components?\n   `StyledToggleGroupRoot` has a border radius of 8, overflow set to hidden, and a flex display with 1px gap between items. `StyledToggleGroupItem` has a gray background color, gray text color, and padding of 3px. When the item is in the \"on\" state, it has a primary color background.\n\n3. What other components or dependencies are required for this code to work?\n   This code requires the `@radix-ui/react-toggle-group` library and the `stitches.config` file for styling. It is possible that other dependencies or components are required elsewhere in the project, but this code file does not indicate that.",
