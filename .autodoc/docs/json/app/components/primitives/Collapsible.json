  "summary": "This code defines a set of components and animations for creating collapsible content in a React application. The main component is `Collapsible`, which takes a `trigger` prop and a `contentProps` prop, and renders a collapsible section of content. When the `trigger` is clicked, the content expands or collapses with a sliding animation.\n\nThe `Collapsible` component is built using the `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` library, which provides a set of primitive components for building collapsible interfaces. The `Collapsible` component wraps these primitives and adds animation and state management.\n\nThe `Collapsible` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the `open` state of the collapsible content. When the `trigger` is clicked, the `open` state is toggled, which causes the content to expand or collapse. The `AnimatePresence` component from the `framer-motion` library is used to animate the content as it enters or exits the DOM.\n\nThe `AnimatedCollapsibleContent` component is a wrapper around the `CollapsibleContent` primitive that adds a sliding animation to the content. The `motion.div` component from `framer-motion` is used to animate the width of the content as it expands or collapses.\n\nThe `CollapsibleRoot` and `CollapsibleContent` components are styled versions of the `Root` and `Content` primitives from `@radix-ui/react-collapsible`. These styles add rounded corners and remove borders from the collapsible content.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and reusable set of components and animations for creating collapsible content in a React application. Here is an example of how the `Collapsible` component might be used:\n\n```\nimport { Collapsible } from 'zoo'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <Collapsible trigger={<button>Click me</button>}>\n      <p>Here is some collapsible content</p>\n    </Collapsible>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Collapsible` component?\n   - The `Collapsible` component is a custom implementation of a collapsible UI element that uses the `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` library and adds animation using `framer-motion`.\n2. What are the `slideDown` and `slideUp` keyframes used for?\n   - The `slideDown` and `slideUp` keyframes are used to animate the height of the collapsible content when it is opened and closed, respectively.\n3. What is the purpose of the `AnimatedCollapsibleContent` component?\n   - The `AnimatedCollapsibleContent` component is a wrapper around the `CollapsibleContent` component that adds animation using `framer-motion` when the collapsible content is opened and closed.",
