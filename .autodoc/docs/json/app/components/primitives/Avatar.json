  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `Avatar` that renders an avatar image with fallback content. The component is built using the `styled` function from the `stitches.config` module, which allows for the creation of custom styled components. The `Avatar` component is composed of three sub-components: `AvatarRoot`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback`.\n\n`AvatarRoot` is a styled component that serves as the root element for the `Avatar` component. It is based on the `Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-avatar` module, which provides basic functionality for displaying an avatar image. `AvatarRoot` adds additional styling to the `Root` component, such as setting the display to `inline-flex`, aligning and justifying the content to the center, and setting the overflow to `hidden`. It also defines two variants: `size` and `corners`. The `size` variant allows for the `Avatar` component to be rendered in different sizes, ranging from `xs` to `xxl`. The `corners` variant allows for the `Avatar` component to be rendered with either rounded corners or as a circle. The default values for these variants are `medium` for `size` and `circle` for `corners`.\n\n`AvatarImage` is a styled component that renders the avatar image. It is based on the `Image` component from the `@radix-ui/react-avatar` module and inherits the `width`, `height`, and `borderRadius` properties from `AvatarRoot`. It also sets the `objectFit` property to `cover`, which scales the image to cover the entire content area while maintaining its aspect ratio.\n\n`AvatarFallback` is a styled component that renders the fallback content for the `Avatar` component. It is based on the `Fallback` component from the `@radix-ui/react-avatar` module and inherits the `width` and `height` properties from `AvatarRoot`. It also sets the `backgroundColor` property to `$gray1`, which is a color value defined in the `stitches.config` module.\n\nThe `Avatar` component is a functional component that renders the `AvatarRoot`, `AvatarImage`, and `AvatarFallback` components. It accepts several props, including `size` and `corners`, which are passed down to `AvatarRoot` as variants. It also accepts a `fallback` prop, which is used as the fallback content for the `AvatarFallback` component. The `forwardRef` function is used to forward the `ref` prop to the `AvatarImage` component.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and customizable way to render avatar images with fallback content in a React application. It can be used in a larger project to display user avatars, profile pictures, or other types of images. Here is an example of how the `Avatar` component can be used:\n\n```\nimport { Avatar } from 'zoo'\n\nfunction UserProfile({ user }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Avatar src={user.avatar} fallback={user.name} size=\"large\" corners=\"rounded\" />\n      <h2>{user.name}</h2>\n      <p>{user.bio}</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Avatar` component?\n- The `Avatar` component is used to display an avatar image or fallback content with customizable size and shape.\n\n2. What is the `delayMs` prop used for in the `AvatarFallback` component?\n- The `delayMs` prop is used to specify the delay time in milliseconds before showing the fallback content.\n\n3. What is the `defaultVariants` object used for in the `AvatarRoot` component?\n- The `defaultVariants` object is used to set the default values for the `size` and `corners` variants of the `AvatarRoot` component.",
