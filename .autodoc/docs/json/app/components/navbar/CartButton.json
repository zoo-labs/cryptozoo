  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `CartButton` that renders a shopping cart icon with a badge indicating the number of items in the user's cart. The component uses several external libraries and components to achieve this functionality.\n\nThe `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` library provides the `faShoppingCart` icon, which is rendered using the `FontAwesomeIcon` component from the `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` library. The `useConnectModal` hook from the `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` library is used to open a modal for connecting a wallet when the user clicks on the cart icon. The `CartPopover` component from the `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui` library is used to display a popover with the user's cart items when the cart icon is clicked.\n\nThe `useCart` hook from the `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui` library is used to retrieve the user's cart items and display the number of items in the badge. The badge is implemented using a `Flex` component from the `components/primitives` module, which positions a `Text` component with the number of items inside a circular `div` element with a background color of `$primary9`.\n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable component for displaying a shopping cart icon with a badge indicating the number of items in the user's cart. This component can be used in various parts of the larger project, such as the header or navigation bar, to provide easy access to the user's cart and encourage them to complete their purchase. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport CartButton from 'path/to/CartButton'\n\nconst Header = () => {\n  return (\n    <header>\n      <nav>\n        <ul>\n          <li><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li>\n          <li><a href=\"/products\">Products</a></li>\n          <li><CartButton /></li>\n        </ul>\n      </nav>\n    </header>\n  )\n}\n```",
