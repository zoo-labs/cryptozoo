  "summary": "The `MobileSearch` component is a React component that renders a search button that, when clicked, opens a search dialog. The dialog contains a search input field and a back button. The search input field is a custom component called `GlobalSearch` that takes a `placeholder` prop. The back button is a `FontAwesomeIcon` component that displays a chevron left icon. \n\nThe search button is a `Button` component from the `components/primitives` module. When clicked, the dialog is opened using the `DialogTrigger` component from the `@radix-ui/react-dialog` module. The `DialogTrigger` component wraps the search button and listens for click events. When a click event is detected, the dialog is opened using the `DialogPortal` component, which renders the dialog outside of the component hierarchy to avoid z-index issues.\n\nThe dialog itself is a `DialogRoot` component from the `@radix-ui/react-dialog` module. It is not a modal, meaning that it does not block user interaction with the rest of the page. The dialog contains a `Content` component from the `components/primitives/Dialog` module, which renders the search input field and the back button. The `Content` component also listens for click events outside of the dialog and prevents them from propagating to the rest of the page.\n\nThe `MobileSearch` component is intended to be used as a reusable search component in the larger project. It can be imported and used in any other component that requires search functionality. For example, it could be used in a header component to provide search functionality in the header. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport MobileSearch from './MobileSearch'\n\nconst Header = () => {\n  return (\n    <header>\n      <nav>\n        <ul>\n          <li><a href=\"/\">Home</a></li>\n          <li><a href=\"/about\">About</a></li>\n          <li><MobileSearch /></li>\n        </ul>\n      </nav>\n    </header>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Header\n```",
