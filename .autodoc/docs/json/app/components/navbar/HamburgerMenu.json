  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `HamburgerMenu` that renders a full-screen modal that appears when a user clicks on a hamburger menu icon. The modal contains a navigation menu that is tailored to the user's account status. If the user is connected to a wallet, the menu displays links to the user's portfolio, collection rankings, and a logout button. If the user is not connected to a wallet, the menu displays links to explore the site, view the documentation, and a button to connect a wallet.\n\nThe component imports several other components and libraries, including `Anchor`, `Box`, `Button`, `Flex`, `FormatCryptoCurrency`, `Text`, `Avatar`, `RadixDialog`, `FontAwesomeIcon`, `Link`, `Image`, `useAccount`, `useDisconnect`, `Jazzicon`, `FullscreenModal`, `useENSResolver`, `ThemeSwitcher`, and `Wallet`. These components and libraries are used to create the various UI elements that make up the modal.\n\nThe `useAccount` and `useDisconnect` hooks are used to retrieve the user's wallet address and to disconnect the user from their wallet, respectively. The `useENSResolver` hook is used to resolve the user's wallet address to a human-readable name and avatar image. The `Jazzicon` component is used to generate a unique icon for the user's wallet address. The `FullscreenModal` component is used to create the modal that appears when the hamburger menu icon is clicked.\n\nThe `HamburgerMenu` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, it could be used as a navigation menu in the header of a page or as a standalone component on a dedicated navigation page. Here is an example of how the `HamburgerMenu` component could be used in a header:\n\n```jsx\nimport HamburgerMenu from 'components/HamburgerMenu'\n\nconst Header = () => {\n  return (\n    <header>\n      <nav>\n        <HamburgerMenu />\n        {/* other navigation elements */}\n      </nav>\n    </header>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Header\n```",
