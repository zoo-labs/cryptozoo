  "summary": "The `ApprovalCollapsible` component is a React component that renders a collapsible section for approving a collection on one or more marketplaces. The component takes in several props, including an `item` object representing the collection to be approved, an array of `batchListingData` objects representing the listings associated with the collection, an array of `selectedMarketplaces` objects representing the marketplaces on which the collection is listed, and an optional `open` boolean indicating whether the collapsible section should be initially open or closed.\n\nThe component first defines some state variables using the `useState` hook, including `collapsibleOpen` which tracks whether the collapsible section is currently open or closed. It then calculates some derived state using the `useMemo` hook, including `marketplacesSeekingApproval` which is an array of unique marketplaces associated with the collection, and `marketplaceNames` which is a string representing the names of the marketplaces seeking approval. The component also defines some variables for displaying the collection image and name.\n\nThe component then defines some side effects using the `useEffect` hook, including one that updates the `collapsibleOpen` state variable based on the `open` prop, and another that sets `collapsibleOpen` to `false` if the `item` object has a `status` of `'complete'`.\n\nFinally, the component renders a `CollapsibleRoot` component from the `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` library, which wraps a collapsible section with a trigger that can be clicked to open or close the section. The trigger is rendered using a `CollapsiblePrimitive.Trigger` component, and consists of a `Flex` container with a colored dot and the text \"Approve Collection\". Clicking the trigger toggles the `collapsibleOpen` state variable, which in turn opens or closes the collapsible section.\n\nThe collapsible section itself is rendered using a `CollapsibleContent` component, and consists of a `Flex` container with the collection image, name, and marketplace names, as well as an optional loading spinner if the `item` object has a `status` of `'incomplete'`. The collapsible section is animated using CSS transitions and animations defined in the `primitives/Collapsible` module.\n\nOverall, the `ApprovalCollapsible` component provides a reusable UI element for approving collections on one or more marketplaces, and can be used in conjunction with other components and modules in the larger project to build out more complex workflows and user interfaces.",
