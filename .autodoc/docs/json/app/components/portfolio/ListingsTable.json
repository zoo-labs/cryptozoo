  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `ListingsTable` that displays a table of listings. The component takes two props: `address`, which is an Ethereum address, and `isOwner`, which is a boolean indicating whether the address is the owner of the listings being displayed. \n\nThe component uses the `useListings` hook from the `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui` library to fetch listings data from a Reservoir marketplace. The `listingsQuery` object is constructed with the `maker` property set to the `address` prop, and other properties set to retrieve additional metadata about the listings. The `useListings` hook returns an object with `data`, `mutate`, `fetchNextPage`, `isFetchingPage`, and `isValidating` properties. \n\nThe component renders a table with columns for the item image, listed price, expiration time, marketplace, and a button for either cancelling the listing (if `isOwner` is true) or buying the item. The `ListingTableRow` component is used to render each row of the table. \n\nThe `useMediaQuery` hook from the `react-responsive` library is used to determine whether the device is a small screen size, and the table is rendered differently depending on the screen size. \n\nThe `useIntersectionObserver` hook from the `usehooks-ts` library is used to detect when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the table, and `fetchNextPage` is called to load more listings. \n\nThe `useTimeSince` hook from the `hooks` module is used to display the time since the listing's expiration time. \n\nOverall, this code provides a reusable component for displaying listings from a Reservoir marketplace, with options for cancelling or buying listings depending on the user's ownership status.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ListingsTable` component and what props does it expect?\n- The `ListingsTable` component is responsible for rendering a table of listings. It expects an `address` prop of type `Address` or `undefined` and an `isOwner` prop of type `boolean`.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useListings` hook and what parameters does it accept?\n- The `useListings` hook is used to fetch a list of listings. It accepts an object of type `Parameters<typeof useListings>['0']` as its only parameter, which includes various query parameters such as `maker`, `includeCriteriaMetadata`, and `includeRawData`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `BuyNow` and `CancelListing` components and what props do they expect?\n- The `BuyNow` component is responsible for rendering a button that allows a user to purchase a listing. It expects `tokenId`, `collectionId`, `orderId`, `mutate`, `buttonCss`, and `buttonChildren` props.\n- The `CancelListing` component is responsible for rendering a button that allows a user to cancel a listing. It expects `listingId`, `mutate`, and `trigger` props.",
