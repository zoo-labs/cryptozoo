  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `Footer` that renders a footer section for a website. The footer contains links to various sections of the website, including documentation, API reference, jobs, terms of use, and privacy policy. The component is composed of several smaller components, including `SectionTitle` and `SectionLink`, which are used to render the titles and links for each section.\n\nThe `Footer` component is exported as a named export, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, if the project has a main `App` component that renders the entire website, the `Footer` component could be included at the bottom of the `App` component to provide a consistent footer across all pages.\n\nThe `Footer` component is implemented using the `Flex` component from a custom `primitives` module, which provides a set of reusable UI components for the project. The `Flex` component is used to create a flexible layout for the footer, with two columns of links for the \"Developers\" and \"Company\" sections, and a separate column for social media links.\n\nThe `SectionTitle` component is a simple wrapper around the `Text` component from the `primitives` module, which renders a title for each section of the footer. The `SectionLink` component is a wrapper around the `Anchor` component from the `primitives` module, which renders a link with a name and href.\n\nThe `developerSectionLinks` and `companySectionLinks` arrays define the links for each section of the footer. These arrays are used to render the links using the `SectionLink` component.\n\nFinally, the `Footer` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project using a default import. For example, if another module needs to render the footer, it could import the `Footer` component using `import Footer from './Footer'`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Footer` component?\n- The `Footer` component is used to render a footer section on a webpage.\n\n2. What are the `developerSectionLinks` and `companySectionLinks` arrays used for?\n- The `developerSectionLinks` and `companySectionLinks` arrays are used to store objects containing the name and href properties of links that are displayed in the footer section.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `SectionTitle` and `SectionLink` components?\n- The `SectionTitle` component is used to render a title for a section in the footer, while the `SectionLink` component is used to render a link with a name and href property in a section of the footer.",
