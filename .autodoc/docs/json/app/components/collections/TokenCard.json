  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `TokenCard` that renders a card displaying information about a specific token. The component takes in several props, including the `token` object, which contains information about the token being displayed, and the `address` of the current user. \n\nThe card displays the token's name, rarity rank (if applicable), and last sale price (if available). It also displays an image or video of the token, if one is available. If the token is in the user's cart, a checkmark appears in the top right corner of the card. \n\nIf the user is the owner of the token and the token is for sale, a \"Buy Now\" button appears at the bottom of the card. If the `addToCartEnabled` prop is true (which it is by default), an \"Add to Cart\" button also appears. \n\nThe `TokenCard` component uses several other components and hooks from the `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`, `components`, `context`, `hooks`, `next/link`, `react`, `swr`, `utils`, and `wagmi` modules. \n\nHere is an example of how the `TokenCard` component might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport TokenCard from 'components/TokenCard'\nimport { useDynamicTokens } from '@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui'\nimport { useWallet } from 'hooks'\n\nconst MyCollection = () => {\n  const { address } = useWallet()\n  const { data: tokens } = useDynamicTokens()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {tokens.map((token) => (\n        <TokenCard\n          key={token.token.tokenId}\n          token={token}\n          address={address}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyCollection` component displays a list of tokens using the `TokenCard` component. The `useDynamicTokens` hook is used to fetch the tokens from a backend API, and the `useWallet` hook is used to get the user's address. The `TokenCard` component is rendered for each token in the `tokens` array, passing in the `token` object and the user's `address`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines a React component called `TokenCard` that renders a card displaying information about a token, including its media, name, price, and last sale.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several external libraries and components, including `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`, `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`, `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`, `next/link`, `react`, `swr`, and `wagmi`.\n\n3. What props does the `TokenCard` component accept, and what is their purpose?\n- The `TokenCard` component accepts several props, including `token` (an object containing information about the token to be displayed), `address` (the address of the current user), `rarityEnabled` (a boolean indicating whether to display the rarity of the token), `addToCartEnabled` (a boolean indicating whether to display an \"Add to Cart\" button), `mutate` (a function to mutate the token data), `onMediaPlayed` (a function to be called when the media is played), `tokenCount` (a string indicating the number of tokens to display), and `orderQuantity` (a number indicating the quantity of tokens to display).",
