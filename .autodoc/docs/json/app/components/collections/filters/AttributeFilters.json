  "summary": "The code is a React component that renders a collapsible panel containing a list of attribute filters. The component takes in several props, including `attributes`, which is an array of objects representing the available filters, and `open` and `setOpen`, which control whether the panel is expanded or collapsed. \n\nThe component uses the `Collapsible` component from the `@radix-ui/react-collapsible` library to create the collapsible panel. The `Collapsible.Root` component is used to wrap the content of the panel, and its `open` prop is set to the `open` prop passed to the component. The `onOpenChange` prop is set to the `setOpen` prop, which updates the `open` state when the panel is expanded or collapsed. The `style` prop is used to set the width of the panel based on whether it is open or closed.\n\nThe content of the panel is rendered using the `CollapsibleContent` component, which is a custom component that applies some styles to the content. The content is wrapped in a `Box` component from the `components/primitives` module, which applies some additional styles to the content.\n\nThe `attributes` prop is used to render a list of `AttributeSelector` components, which are custom components that render a single attribute filter. The `attributes` array is filtered to exclude any filters of type \"number\", and then mapped to an array of `AttributeSelector` components. Each `AttributeSelector` component takes in an `attribute` prop, which is an object representing a single filter, and a `scrollToTop` prop, which is a function that scrolls the page to the top when called.\n\nIf the `attributes` prop is empty or undefined, a loading spinner is rendered instead of the list of filters.\n\nOverall, this component provides a reusable way to render a collapsible panel containing a list of attribute filters, which can be used in various parts of the larger project. The `AttributeSelector` component can be customized to render different types of filters, and the `Collapsible` component can be used to create other types of collapsible panels.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AttributeFilters` component?\n- The `AttributeFilters` component is used to display a list of attribute selectors based on the data passed in as props.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `Collapsible` and `CollapsibleContent` components?\n- The `Collapsible` and `CollapsibleContent` components are used to create a collapsible container that can be opened and closed by the user.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `LoadingSpinner` component?\n- The `LoadingSpinner` component is used to display a loading animation when there are no attributes to display.",
