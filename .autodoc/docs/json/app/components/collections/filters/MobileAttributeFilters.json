  "summary": "The `MobileAttributeFilters` component is a React functional component that renders a modal dialog containing a list of attribute filters for a mobile view. The component receives two props: `attributes` and `scrollToTop`. The `attributes` prop is an array of objects that represent the available filters, and `scrollToTop` is a function that scrolls the page to the top.\n\nThe component uses several third-party libraries, including `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`, `next/router`, and `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`. It also imports several components from the `components` and `utils` directories.\n\nThe component starts by extracting all queries of attribute type from the router object and setting the number of filters to the length of the resulting array. It then renders a button that triggers the modal dialog. If there are no attributes available, the component returns null.\n\nThe modal dialog contains a header with a title and a close button, a list of attribute filters, and a footer with a clear button. The attribute filters are rendered using the `AttributeSelector` component, which receives an attribute object and the `scrollToTop` function as props.\n\nThe component uses CSS-in-JS to style the elements, including the position of the button, the size and color of the filter count badge, and the appearance of the clear button.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that requires filtering of data based on attributes. It provides a mobile-friendly interface for selecting and clearing filters, and can be easily customized to fit the project's design. An example of how this component can be used is in an e-commerce website where users can filter products by attributes such as color, size, and price range.",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n- This code exports a React component called `MobileAttributeFilters` that renders a filter modal with attribute selectors based on the `attributes` prop and the current URL query parameters.\n\n2. What external libraries does this code use?\n- This code imports several external libraries including `react`, `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `components/primitives`, `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`, `next/router`, and `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?\n- The `useEffect` hook is used to extract all queries of attribute type from the current URL query parameters and set the number of filters to display in the filter button. It runs whenever the `router.query` object changes.",
