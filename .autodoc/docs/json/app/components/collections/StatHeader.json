  "summary": "The `StatHeader` component in this file is used to display statistics about a collection of tokens in a UI. It imports several components from other files, including `useCollections` from `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`, `Text`, `Box`, and `Grid` from `components/primitives`, and `useMounted` and `useMediaQuery` from `hooks`. It also imports a `formatNumber` function from `utils/numbers`.\n\nThe `StatHeader` component takes a single prop, `collection`, which is an object containing data about the collection of tokens being displayed. This data is obtained using the `useCollections` hook, which is not defined in this file. The `StatHeader` component then uses this data to display several statistics about the collection, including the floor price, top offer price, percentage of tokens listed for sale, total volume, and token count.\n\nThe `StatHeader` component is composed of several `StatBox` components, which are defined earlier in the file. The `StatBox` component takes two props, `label` and `children`, and renders a box with a label and the provided children. The `StatHeader` component uses `StatBox` components to display each statistic about the collection.\n\nThe `StatHeader` component also uses the `FormatCryptoCurrency` component to format the floor price and top offer price as cryptocurrency amounts. It uses the `formatNumber` function to format the token count and percentage of tokens listed for sale.\n\nOverall, this file provides a reusable `StatHeader` component that can be used to display statistics about a collection of tokens in a UI. It uses several other components and hooks to obtain and format the necessary data. An example usage of this component might look like:\n\n```\nimport StatHeader from 'components/StatHeader'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const collection = useCollectionData() // some function to obtain collection data\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <StatHeader collection={collection} />\n      {/* other UI elements */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `StatHeader` component?\n- The `StatHeader` component is used to display various statistics related to a collection, such as the floor price, top offer, listed percentage, total volume, and count.\n\n2. What external libraries or components are being used in this code?\n- The code is importing several components from `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`, `components/primitives`, and `hooks`. It is also using the `useMediaQuery` hook and the `formatNumber` utility function from `utils/numbers`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `isSmallDevice` variable and how is it used?\n- The `isSmallDevice` variable is used to determine whether the current device has a maximum width of 600 pixels. It is used to conditionally render the \"Listed\" statistic in the `StatHeader` component, as this statistic is not displayed on small devices.",
