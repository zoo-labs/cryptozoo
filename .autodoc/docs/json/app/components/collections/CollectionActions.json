  "summary": "This code exports a React component called `CollectionActions` that renders a set of actions that can be performed on a collection. The component takes a single prop called `collection`, which is an object containing information about the collection. \n\nThe component renders a set of icons that represent actions that can be performed on the collection. These icons include an icon for opening the collection on Etherscan, an icon for opening the collection's website, an icon for opening the collection's Discord server, and an icon for refreshing the collection's metadata. \n\nThe component is responsive and will render different sets of icons depending on the screen size. On mobile screens, the icons are rendered in a dropdown menu, while on larger screens, the icons are rendered in a row. \n\nThe `CollectionActions` component uses a number of other components and hooks to render the icons and handle user interactions. These include the `FontAwesomeIcon` component from the `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` package, the `Dropdown` component from the `components/primitives/Dropdown` module, and the `useMediaQuery` hook from the `react-responsive` package. \n\nThe `CollectionActions` component also uses a number of custom styles defined using the `styled` function from the `stitches.config` module. These styles define the appearance of the icons and the dropdown menu. \n\nOverall, the `CollectionActions` component provides a convenient way for users to perform common actions on a collection, such as viewing it on Etherscan or refreshing its metadata. It is designed to be flexible and responsive, so that it can be used on a variety of different devices and screen sizes.",
