  "summary": "The `TokenActions` component is responsible for rendering a set of buttons that allow users to interact with a specific token. The component takes in several props, including the `token`, `offer`, `listing`, `isOwner`, `mutate`, and `account`. \n\nThe `token` prop is an object that contains information about the token being interacted with, including its ID, collection, and market data. The `offer` and `listing` props are objects that contain information about any offers or listings associated with the token. The `isOwner` prop is a boolean that indicates whether the current user is the owner of the token. The `mutate` prop is a function that can be used to update the state of the component. Finally, the `account` prop is an object that contains information about the user's account.\n\nThe component first sets up some variables based on the props and the current router query. It then renders a set of buttons based on the state of the token and the user's permissions. These buttons include options to list the token for sale, create a new listing, buy the token, bid on the token, accept an offer, and cancel a listing or offer.\n\nThe component also includes some conditional rendering based on the type of token being interacted with. For example, if the token is an ERC1155 token, some buttons will not be rendered. Additionally, if the user is not the owner of the token, some buttons will not be rendered.\n\nOverall, the `TokenActions` component provides a simple way for users to interact with a specific token, allowing them to buy, sell, and bid on tokens as well as manage their own listings and offers.",
