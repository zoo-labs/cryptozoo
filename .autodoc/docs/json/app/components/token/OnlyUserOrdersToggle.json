  "summary": "The code above defines a React functional component called `OnlyUserOrdersToggle`. This component renders a toggle switch with a label that reads \"Only Mine\". The toggle switch is used to filter orders in a larger project. \n\nThe component takes in two props: `checked` and `onCheckedChange`. The `checked` prop is a boolean value that determines whether the toggle switch is on or off. The `onCheckedChange` prop is a callback function that is called when the toggle switch is clicked. This function takes in a boolean value that represents the new state of the toggle switch.\n\nThe component is built using the `Flex`, `Switch`, and `Text` components from the `components/primitives` module. The `Flex` component is used to create a container that aligns its children vertically and horizontally. The `Switch` component is used to render the toggle switch. The `Text` component is used to render the label.\n\nThe `css` prop is used to style the `Flex` component. The `width` property is set to `100%` to ensure that the component takes up the full width of its container. The `backgroundColor` property is set to `$gray2`, which is a predefined color value. The `borderRadius` property is set to `4` to give the component rounded corners. The `py` and `px` properties are used to add padding to the top/bottom and left/right of the component, respectively. The `gap` property is used to add spacing between the label and the toggle switch.\n\nTo use this component in a larger project, it can be imported and rendered like any other React component. For example:\n\n```\nimport { OnlyUserOrdersToggle } from 'zoo'\n\nfunction OrdersPage() {\n  const [onlyMine, setOnlyMine] = useState(false)\n\n  function handleToggleChange(checked) {\n    setOnlyMine(checked)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <OnlyUserOrdersToggle\n        checked={onlyMine}\n        onCheckedChange={handleToggleChange}\n      />\n      {/* Render orders based on the value of `onlyMine` */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `OnlyUserOrdersToggle` component is rendered with the `checked` prop set to the `onlyMine` state variable and the `onCheckedChange` prop set to a callback function that updates the `onlyMine` state variable. The `onlyMine` state variable is then used to filter the orders that are rendered on the page.",
  "questions": "1. What are the required dependencies for this code to work?\n- The code requires the `components/primitives` module and the `react` module to be imported.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `OnlyUserOrdersToggle` component?\n- The component is a toggle switch with a label \"Only Mine\" and a switch that can be toggled on or off. It takes in a boolean value for the `checked` prop and a function for the `onCheckedChange` prop that is called when the switch is toggled.\n\n3. What styling is applied to the toggle switch?\n- The toggle switch is wrapped in a `Flex` component with a gray background color, rounded corners, and padding. The label and switch are spaced apart with a gap and aligned to the center and between the start and end of the container. The label is styled with a `subtitle2` text style and a subtle color.",
