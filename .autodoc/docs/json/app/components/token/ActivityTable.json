  "summary": "This code file imports various modules and components to create a table that displays activity data related to tokens, users, and collections. The `TokenActivityTable` component takes in an `id` and `activityTypes` prop, which are used to fetch and display token activity data. The `ActivityTable` component takes in a `data` prop, which contains the activity data to be displayed in the table. \n\nThe `ActivityTableRow` component is used to render each row of the table and takes in an `activity` prop, which contains the data for that row. The `logos` object contains icons for different types of activities, which are displayed next to the activity description in each row. The `activityTypeToDesciptionMap` object maps activity types to their corresponding descriptions, which are displayed in each row. \n\nThe `useMediaQuery` hook is used to determine whether the device is a small device, and the table is rendered differently depending on the device size. The `useMarketplaceChain` hook is used to get the block explorer URL for the current marketplace chain. The `useENSResolver` hook is used to get the display name for Ethereum addresses. The `useTimeSince` hook is used to display the time since an activity occurred. \n\nThe `ActivityTable` component uses the `useIntersectionObserver` hook to detect when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the table and fetches more data if necessary. The `LoadingSpinner` component is displayed while data is being fetched. \n\nOverall, this code file provides a reusable table component that can be used to display activity data for tokens, users, and collections. It uses various hooks and components to create a responsive and dynamic table that can handle large amounts of data. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { TokenActivityTable } from 'path/to/ActivityTable'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const tokenId = '123'\n  const activityTypes = ['mint', 'transfer', 'sale']\n  \n  return (\n    <TokenActivityTable id={tokenId} activityTypes={activityTypes} />\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `zoo` project?\n- The code does not provide any information about the purpose of the `zoo` project. \n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n- The code imports several dependencies from external libraries such as `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`, `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`, `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`, `ethers`, `next/link`, `react`, `react-responsive`, and `usehooks-ts`.\n\n3. What are the types of activities that can be displayed in the `ActivityTable` component?\n- The `ActivityTable` component can display activities of type `CollectionActivity`, `UsersActivity`, and `TokenActivity`. The types of activities are defined in the `CollectionActivityTypes`, `UserActivityTypes`, and `TokenActivityTypes` types.",
