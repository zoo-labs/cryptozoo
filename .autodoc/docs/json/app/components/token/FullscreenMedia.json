  "summary": "The `FullscreenMedia` component in the `zoo` project is responsible for rendering a full-screen media view of a given token. The component takes in a single prop, `token`, which is an object that contains information about the token to be displayed. \n\nThe component first extracts the media type from the token using the `extractMediaType` function from the `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui` library. If the media type is one of `png`, `jpeg`, `jpg`, `gif`, `null`, or `undefined`, the component renders a full-screen media view. Otherwise, it returns `null`.\n\nThe full-screen media view is implemented using the `@radix-ui/react-dialog` and `framer-motion` libraries. When the user clicks on the expand button, a dialog is opened that covers the entire screen. The dialog contains a close button and a `TokenMedia` component from the `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui` library that displays the media associated with the token. The `TokenMedia` component is styled to have no border radius, a width of `100vw`, and a height of `auto`. The `motion` library is used to animate the opening and closing of the dialog.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger `zoo` project to display media associated with a token in a full-screen view. It provides a simple and intuitive way for users to view media without leaving the current page. An example of how this component can be used is as follows:\n\n```jsx\nimport FullscreenMedia from 'zoo/FullscreenMedia'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const token = { /* token data */ }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {/* other content */}\n      <FullscreenMedia token={token} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
