  "summary": "This code is a serverless function that handles search queries for collections and wallets on various blockchain networks. The function takes a query parameter from the request URL and uses it to search for collections and wallets on supported blockchain networks. The search results are then sorted by all-time USD volume and returned as a JSON response.\n\nThe function first imports the necessary dependencies, including the ethers library for Ethereum blockchain interactions, the fetcher utility for making HTTP requests, the paths and supportedChains modules for defining API paths and supported blockchain networks respectively.\n\nThe function then defines two types, SearchCollection and Collection, which represent the shape of the response objects returned by the Reservoir API for collection search and collection details respectively.\n\nThe function also defines a config object with a runtime property set to 'experimental-edge', which is used by the serverless function provider to specify the runtime environment for the function.\n\nThe main function handler takes a request object as an argument and extracts the query parameter from the URL. It then initializes an empty array to hold the search results and an array of promises to hold the results of the search queries on each supported blockchain network.\n\nThe function then iterates over the supportedChains array and pushes a fetcher promise for each network to the promises array. The fetcher promise makes an HTTP GET request to the Reservoir API for collection search with the query parameter and other parameters specific to the network. The results of each promise are then stored in the responses array.\n\nIf the query parameter is an Ethereum address, the function creates a new array of promises to fetch collection details for the address on each supported network. The results of each promise are then processed into a SearchCollection object and stored in the results array.\n\nIf the query parameter is a URL, the function attempts to resolve it to an Ethereum address using the ENSideas API. If the address is found, it is processed into a wallet object and stored in the results array.\n\nIf the query parameter is neither an Ethereum address nor a URL, the function fetches the current USD prices for each supported network and uses them to calculate the all-time USD volume for each collection in the search results. The search results are then sorted by all-time USD volume and returned as a JSON response.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and extensible way to search for collections and wallets on various blockchain networks. It can be used as a standalone API or integrated into a larger project that requires blockchain search functionality.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `fetcher` function and where is it defined?\n- A smart developer might wonder what the `fetcher` function does and where it is defined. \n- The `fetcher` function is imported from a module located at `utils/fetcher`. It is used to make HTTP requests to an API endpoint and returns a Promise that resolves to the response data.\n\n2. What is the expected shape of the `SearchCollection` and `Collection` types?\n- A smart developer might want to know the expected shape of the `SearchCollection` and `Collection` types. \n- The `SearchCollection` type is a union of the first element of the `collections` array in the response schema of a GET request to `/search/collections/v1` endpoint, with additional properties `chainName`, `chainId`, `lightChainIcon`, `darkChainIcon`, `volumeCurrencySymbol`, `volumeCurrencyDecimals`, and `tokenCount`. \n- The `Collection` type is the first element of the `collections` array in the response schema of a GET request to `/collections/v5` endpoint.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `config` object and what does it do?\n- A smart developer might be curious about the `config` object and what it does. \n- The `config` object is an experimental feature that sets the runtime environment to `experimental-edge`. This enables the use of experimental features that are not yet available in the stable release of the runtime environment.",
