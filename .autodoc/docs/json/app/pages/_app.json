  "summary": "This code is the entry point for a Next.js application that serves as a marketplace for NFTs. The code imports various components and providers that are used throughout the application. \n\nThe `AppWrapper` function is the main component that wraps the entire application. It is responsible for setting up the theme provider, the analytics provider, the error tracking provider, and the `MyApp` component. \n\nThe `MyApp` component is the main component that renders the pages of the application. It sets up the `ReservoirKitProvider`, which is a UI library for building NFT marketplaces. It also sets up the `RainbowKitProvider`, which is a UI library for building Ethereum wallets. \n\nThe `ReservoirKitProvider` is configured with various options, including the chains that the marketplace supports, the source of the marketplace, and whether or not to normalize royalties. The `CartProvider` is also included in the `ReservoirKitProvider`, which manages the user's cart. \n\nThe `RainbowKitProvider` is configured with the chains that the wallet supports and the theme of the wallet. \n\nThe `AppWrapper` and `MyApp` components are wrapped in various providers, including the `ThemeProvider`, which sets up the dark and light themes of the application, and the `WagmiConfig`, which is a client for interacting with Ethereum. \n\nOverall, this code sets up the necessary providers and components for building a marketplace for NFTs. It uses various UI libraries to provide a seamless experience for users. \n\nExample usage: \n\n```jsx\nimport AppWrapper from 'path/to/AppWrapper'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <AppWrapper>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </AppWrapper>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n```",

What is the purpose of the `AppWrapper` and `MyApp` functions?\n- `AppWrapper` is a higher-order component that wraps the `MyApp` component and provides context providers for `WagmiConfig`, `AnalyticsProvider`, and `ErrorTrackingProvider`. `MyApp` is the main component that renders the `Component` passed to it as a prop along with other components and providers for theming, hotkeys, and toast notifications.\n3. What is the purpose of the `supportedChains` variable?\n- `supportedChains` is an array of objects that define the supported blockchain networks for the application. It is used to configure the chains and providers for the `wagmiClient` and `ReservoirKitProvider`.",
