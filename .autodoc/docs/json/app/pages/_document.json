  "summary": "The code is a React component that extends the `Document` class from the `next/document` module. It is used to define the HTML document structure for the Next.js application. The `MyDocument` class overrides the `getInitialProps` method to fetch the initial props from the `Document` class. The `render` method returns the HTML document structure with the following elements:\n\n- `Html`: The root element of the HTML document.\n- `Head`: The element that contains the metadata of the HTML document, such as the title, description, and keywords.\n- `style`: The element that contains the CSS styles generated by the `getCssText` function from the `../stitches.config` module.\n- `meta`: The element that contains the metadata of the HTML document, such as the character set, viewport, and keywords.\n- `link`: The element that contains the favicon of the HTML document.\n- `body`: The element that contains the body of the HTML document.\n- `Main`: The element that renders the main content of the Next.js application.\n- `NextScript`: The element that renders the scripts required by the Next.js application.\n\nThe `MyDocument` class is used to customize the HTML document structure of the Next.js application. It is typically used to add global styles, metadata, and scripts to the HTML document. For example, the `style` element is used to add the CSS styles generated by the `getCssText` function to the HTML document. The `meta` element is used to add metadata such as keywords and viewport to the HTML document. The `link` element is used to add the favicon of the HTML document. The `Main` and `NextScript` elements are used to render the main content and scripts of the Next.js application, respectively.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport MyDocument from '../path/to/MyDocument'\n\nfunction MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {\n  return (\n    <MyDocument>\n      <Component {...pageProps} />\n    </MyDocument>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MyApp\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `getInitialProps` method in this code?\n   - The `getInitialProps` method is used to retrieve the initial props of the `Document` component, which is extended by `MyDocument`.\n\n2. What is the `stitches.config` file and what does the `getCssText` function do?\n   - The `stitches.config` file is likely a configuration file for a CSS-in-JS library called Stitches. The `getCssText` function likely retrieves the CSS styles generated by Stitches and returns them as a string.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `reservoir` meta tags?\n   - The `reservoir` meta tags are likely used by the Reservoir Market platform to provide metadata about the NFTs being sold on the platform, such as the title, icon, and URLs for the tokens on different networks.",
