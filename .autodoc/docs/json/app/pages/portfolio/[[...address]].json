  "summary": "The code is a Next.js page component that renders a portfolio view for a user's NFTs (non-fungible tokens). The component imports various UI components from the project's `components` directory, as well as utility functions from external libraries such as `react-responsive` and `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`. \n\nThe component first retrieves the user's account address and connection status using the `useAccount` hook from the `wagmi` library. It then retrieves the address from the query parameters of the current route using the `useRouter` hook from Next.js. If no address is specified in the query parameters, the user's own address is used. \n\nThe component then sets up various state variables using the `useState` hook from React. These include the currently selected tab, the view mode for the user's NFTs (either a list or grid view), the types of activity to display in the activity tab, and whether to show or hide various filter menus. \n\nThe component then uses several more hooks to retrieve data from external APIs. These include `useUserCollections` and `useUserTokens` from the `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui` library, which retrieve the user's NFT collections and tokens, respectively. The component also uses `useCollectionActivity` from the same library to retrieve the user's NFT activity. \n\nThe component then renders the UI for the portfolio view using the imported UI components. The UI includes a tabbed interface with tabs for the user's NFTs, listings, offers, and activity. The NFTs tab displays a table or grid of the user's NFTs, with various filter and sort options. The listings and offers tabs display tables of the user's active listings and offers, respectively. The activity tab displays a table of the user's NFT activity, with filter options for the types of activity to display. \n\nThe component also includes various UI elements for toggling between list and grid view modes, filtering NFTs by collection, and sorting NFTs by various criteria. It also includes a \"batch actions\" feature for selecting multiple NFTs and performing actions on them, such as creating listings. \n\nOverall, this component provides a comprehensive view of a user's NFT portfolio, with various filter and sort options and the ability to perform batch actions on multiple NFTs. It is likely used as part of a larger project that includes other features related to NFTs and blockchain technology.",
  "questions": "1. What libraries and frameworks are being used in this code?\n- The code is using Next.js, React, and several other libraries such as Radix UI, Reservoir Kit UI, and Font Awesome.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `IndexPage` component?\n- The `IndexPage` component is the main page for the portfolio feature of the project. It displays a user's NFT collections, listings, offers, and activity.\n\n3. What state variables are being used in this code?\n- The code is using several state variables such as `tabValue`, `itemView`, `activityTypes`, `activityFiltersOpen`, `tokenFiltersOpen`, `filterCollection`, `sortByType`, `isSmallDevice`, `isMounted`, `isOwner`, `showListingPage`, and `selectedItems`. These variables are used to manage the UI and user interactions in the portfolio page.",
