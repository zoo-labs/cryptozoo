  "summary": "The code is a Next.js page component that renders a portfolio dashboard for a user's NFTs. The page is composed of several components from the project's `components` directory, including `Layout`, `TokenTable`, `ConnectWalletButton`, `MobileTokenFilters`, `TokenFilters`, `FilterButton`, `PortfolioSortDropdown`, `CollectionsTable`, `ListingsTable`, and `OffersTable`. \n\nThe page is conditionally rendered based on whether the user is connected to a wallet or not. If the user is not connected, the page displays a message prompting the user to connect their wallet. If the user is connected, the page displays a portfolio dashboard with several tabs that allow the user to view their NFTs, collections, listings, and offers made. \n\nThe `TokenTable` component displays a table of the user's NFTs, with options to filter by collection and sort by various criteria. The `MobileTokenFilters` and `TokenFilters` components provide the filtering options for the `TokenTable`. The `FilterButton` component toggles the visibility of the filtering options. The `PortfolioSortDropdown` component provides the sorting options for the `TokenTable`. \n\nThe `CollectionsTable`, `ListingsTable`, and `OffersTable` components display tables of the user's collections, listings, and offers made, respectively. \n\nThe `ConnectWalletButton` component allows the user to connect their wallet to the application. \n\nThe `ChainToggle` component allows the user to switch between different blockchain networks. \n\nThe `Head` component sets the page's metadata, including the title and description. \n\nOverall, this code provides a user-friendly interface for managing and viewing a user's NFTs and related data. It is a key component of the larger `zoo` project, which aims to provide a comprehensive platform for buying, selling, and managing NFTs.",
