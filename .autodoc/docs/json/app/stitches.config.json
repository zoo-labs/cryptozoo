  "summary": "This code is responsible for creating and configuring the theme for the `zoo` project. It uses the `@stitches/react` library to create a theme object that contains various properties such as colors, fonts, sizes, and media queries. The `createStitches` function is used to create the theme object and also returns several utility functions that can be used to create styles for components.\n\nThe `colors` property of the theme object is defined using the `@radix-ui/colors` library, which provides a set of predefined color scales. These color scales are then combined and aliased to create the final color palette for the project. The `createTheme` function is used to create a dark theme that is a variation of the main theme.\n\nThe `utils` property of the theme object contains various utility functions that can be used to create styles for components. These functions include margin, padding, width, height, and grid-related functions. The `media` property contains various media queries that can be used to create responsive styles for components.\n\nThe `globalCss` function is used to apply a global CSS reset to the project. The `Inter` font from Google Fonts is also imported and used as the default font for the project.\n\nOverall, this code provides a centralized way to manage the theme for the `zoo` project. It allows for easy customization of the color palette and provides utility functions that can be used to create consistent styles for components. Here is an example of how the `styled` function can be used to create a styled component using the theme:\n\n```\nimport { styled } from 'zoo'\n\nconst Button = styled('button', {\n  backgroundColor: '$primary1',\n  color: '$whiteA11',\n  padding: '$2',\n  borderRadius: '$radii',\n  '&:hover': {\n    backgroundColor: '$primary2',\n  },\n})\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `createStitches` function and what does it return?\n- The `createStitches` function is used to create a styling system for the project using the `@stitches/react` library.

What is the purpose of the `utils` object within the `createStitches` function?\n- The `utils` object contains utility functions that can be used to generate CSS properties for margin, padding, dimensions, and grid.

What is the purpose of the `darkTheme` object and how is it different from the default theme?\n- The `darkTheme` object is an alternative theme that can be used for dark mode. It contains different color values for the same color aliases used in the default theme, as well as some additional color values for accent and panel styling.",
