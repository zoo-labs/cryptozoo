  "summary": "This code defines an array of `ExpirationOption` objects and exports it as the default export of the module. Each `ExpirationOption` object represents a different expiration time option that can be selected by a user in the larger project. \n\nEach `ExpirationOption` object has four properties: `text`, `value`, `relativeTime`, and `relativeTimeUnit`. The `text` property is a string that represents the display text for the option. The `value` property is a string that represents the value of the option. The `relativeTime` property is a number that represents the relative time for the option. The `relativeTimeUnit` property is a string that represents the unit of time for the option.\n\nFor example, the first `ExpirationOption` object represents an option for a 1 hour expiration time. The `text` property is \"1 Hour\", the `value` property is \"hour\", the `relativeTime` property is 1, and the `relativeTimeUnit` property is \"h\". \n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to provide users with a list of expiration time options to choose from. The `expirationOptions` array can be imported into other modules and used to populate a dropdown menu or other UI element. For example, the following code could be used to create a dropdown menu of expiration time options:\n\n```\nimport expirationOptions from './path/to/expirationOptions'\n\nconst dropdown = document.createElement('select')\n\nexpirationOptions.forEach(option => {\n  const optionElement = document.createElement('option')\n  optionElement.value = option.value\n  optionElement.text = option.text\n  dropdown.appendChild(optionElement)\n})\n\ndocument.body.appendChild(dropdown)\n```\n\nThis code creates a `select` element and populates it with `option` elements for each `ExpirationOption` object in the `expirationOptions` array. The `value` and `text` properties of each `option` element are set to the corresponding properties of the `ExpirationOption` object. The resulting dropdown menu can be appended to the `body` of the document or another element in the UI.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ExpirationOption` type?\n- The `ExpirationOption` type is likely used to define the structure of objects that represent different expiration options.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `relativeTime` and `relativeTimeUnit` properties?\n- The `relativeTime` property represents the amount of time for the expiration option, while the `relativeTimeUnit` property represents the unit of time (e.g. hours, days, weeks) for the expiration option.\n\n3. How is this module intended to be used in the `zoo` project?\n- It is unclear from this code snippet alone how this module is intended to be used in the `zoo` project. It is possible that it is used to provide a list of expiration options for some feature in the project.",
