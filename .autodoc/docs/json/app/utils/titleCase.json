  "summary": "The `titleCase` function in the `zoo` project is designed to convert a given word to title case format. Title case is a writing style where the first letter of each word is capitalized, except for certain small words like \"and\", \"the\", and \"of\". This function takes a single parameter, `word`, which is the word to be converted to title case. \n\nThe function uses a regular expression to match all words in the input string and then applies a callback function to each match. The callback function takes the matched word and returns a modified version of it in title case format. The modified version is created by capitalizing the first letter of the word using the `toUpperCase()` method and then converting the rest of the word to lowercase using the `toLowerCase()` method. \n\nThis function can be used in a variety of ways within the larger `zoo` project. For example, it could be used to format animal names or exhibit titles in a consistent and professional manner. It could also be used to format user input in forms or search queries to ensure that the input is correctly formatted and matches the expected format. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `titleCase` function:\n\n```typescript\nimport titleCase from './titleCase';\n\nconst animalName = 'giraffe';\nconst formattedName = titleCase(animalName);\nconsole.log(formattedName); // Output: \"Giraffe\"\n```\n\nIn this example, the `titleCase` function is imported from the `titleCase.ts` file and used to format the `animalName` variable. The resulting `formattedName` variable is then logged to the console, which outputs \"Giraffe\".",
