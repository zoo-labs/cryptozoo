  "summary": "This code defines a constant variable called `wrappedContracts` which is a Record object that maps numbers to Ethereum contract addresses. The keys of the Record object are numbers that represent the Ethereum network ID, and the values are the corresponding contract addresses for that network. \n\nThis code is likely used in a larger project that interacts with Ethereum smart contracts. The purpose of this code is to provide a convenient way to access the contract addresses for different Ethereum networks. By using this Record object, developers can easily retrieve the contract address for a specific network ID without having to hardcode the address in their code. \n\nFor example, if a developer wants to interact with a contract on the Ethereum mainnet, they can use the `wrappedContracts` object to retrieve the contract address like this:\n\n```\nimport wrappedContracts from 'zoo'\n\nconst mainnetAddress = wrappedContracts[1]\n```\n\nThis will set the `mainnetAddress` variable to the contract address for the Ethereum mainnet. Similarly, if the developer wants to interact with a contract on the Polygon network, they can retrieve the contract address like this:\n\n```\nconst polygonAddress = wrappedContracts[137]\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a simple and flexible way to manage contract addresses for different Ethereum networks in a larger project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a constant object `wrappedContracts` that maps network IDs to contract addresses.\n\n2. What is the data type of `wrappedContracts`?\n   - The data type of `wrappedContracts` is `Record<number, string>`, which is a TypeScript type that defines an object with numeric keys and string values.\n\n3. How is this code intended to be used?\n   - This code is intended to be imported as a default export from the `zoo` module, and used to retrieve contract addresses based on network IDs.",
