  "summary": "This code defines the configuration for the Next.js project in the zoo project. The `nextConfig` object is exported as the default configuration for the project. \n\nThe `transpilePackages` property is an array of packages that should be transpiled by Next.js. This is useful when using packages that are not compatible with the current version of Node.js or Next.js. In this case, the packages being transpiled are `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`, `@zoolabs/ui`, and `@zoolabs/sdk`.\n\nThe `headers` property is an asynchronous function that returns an array of headers to be used in the project. In this case, the headers are used to set the `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-Frame-Options` headers for all routes in the project. The `Content-Security-Policy` header restricts the sources from which the browser can load resources for the page, while the `X-Frame-Options` header prevents the page from being loaded in an iframe. \n\nThis configuration file is important for setting up the project's security and ensuring that the necessary packages are transpiled. It can be used in conjunction with other configuration files to fully customize the project's behavior. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n// next.config.js\nconst nextConfig = {\n  transpilePackages: ['@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui', \"@zoolabs/ui\", \"@zoolabs/sdk\"],\n  async headers() {\n    return [\n      {\n        source: '/:path*',\n        headers: [\n          {\n            key: 'Content-Security-Policy',\n            value: \"frame-ancestors 'none'\",\n          },\n          {\n            key: 'X-Frame-Options',\n            value: 'DENY',\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n    ]\n  },\n}\n\nmodule.exports = nextConfig;\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code exports a Next.js configuration object that includes transpiling certain packages and setting security headers for all routes.\n\n2. Which packages are being transpiled?\n   The packages being transpiled are '@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui', \"@zoolabs/ui\", and \"@zoolabs/sdk\".\n\n3. What security headers are being set and for which routes?\n   The security headers being set are 'Content-Security-Policy' and 'X-Frame-Options', and they are being set for all routes with the source '/:path*'.",
