  "summary": "The code above is a React component that displays a page header using the `PageHeader` component from the `antd` library. The purpose of this component is to provide a consistent header for the pages in the `zoo` project. \n\nThe `Header` component is exported as the default export of the file and can be imported and used in other components or pages within the `zoo` project. The `Header` component returns a JSX element that contains an anchor tag with a link to the `zoo-labs/savage` GitHub repository. The `PageHeader` component is nested within the anchor tag and takes three props: `title`, `subTitle`, and `style`. \n\nThe `title` prop is set to \"lab\" and is displayed as the main title of the header. The `subTitle` prop is an empty string and is not displayed. The `style` prop is an object that sets the `cursor` property to \"pointer\", which changes the cursor to a hand icon when hovering over the header, indicating that it is clickable. \n\nHere is an example of how the `Header` component can be used in a page within the `zoo` project:\n\n```\nimport React from \"react\";\nimport Header from \"./Header\";\n\nfunction HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Header />\n      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo!</h1>\n      <p>Explore our collection of animals and exhibits.</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default HomePage;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `Header` component is imported and used at the top of the `HomePage` component to display the consistent header for the page. The `HomePage` component also includes a heading and paragraph to provide content specific to the page. \n\nOverall, the `Header` component provides a reusable and consistent header for pages within the `zoo` project, enhancing the user experience and branding of the project.",
