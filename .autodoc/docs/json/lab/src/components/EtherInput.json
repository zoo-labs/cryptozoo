  "summary": "The `EtherInput` component is a React component that displays an input field for entering an amount of ether or USD, with an option to convert between the two. It is imported from the `antd` library and uses the `Input` component from that library. \n\nThe component takes several props, including `price`, `value`, `placeholder`, `autoFocus`, and `onChange`. The `price` prop is used to specify the current price of ether in USD, which is used to convert between the two currencies. The `value` prop is used to specify the initial value of the input field. The `placeholder` prop is used to specify the placeholder text for the input field. The `autoFocus` prop is used to specify whether the input field should be automatically focused when the component is mounted. The `onChange` prop is used to specify a callback function that is called whenever the value of the input field changes.\n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the component. It uses the `mode` state to keep track of whether the input field is currently displaying ether or USD. It uses the `display` state to keep track of the current value of the input field, which may be different from the `value` prop if the user has entered a new value. It uses the `value` state to keep track of the current value of the input field, which is used to calculate the converted value if the user switches between ether and USD. \n\nThe component uses the `useEffect` hook to update the `display` state whenever the `currentValue` changes. The `currentValue` is calculated based on the `value` prop and the current value of the input field. If the `currentValue` is not defined, the `display` state is set to an empty string.\n\nThe component uses the `option` function to render a button that allows the user to switch between ether and USD. The function takes a `title` argument, which is used to specify the text of the button. If the `price` prop is not defined, the function returns an empty string. Otherwise, it returns a `div` element with the specified `title` text and an `onClick` handler that switches the `mode` state and updates the `display` state based on the current value of the input field and the `price` prop.\n\nThe component uses the `prefix` and `addonAfter` props of the `Input` component to display the currency symbol and the switch button, respectively. The `prefix` is set to \"$\" if the `mode` is USD, and \"Îž\" if the `mode` is ether. The `addonAfter` is set to the result of calling the `option` function with the appropriate title text.\n\nThe component uses the `onChange` prop of the `Input` component to update the `value` and `display` states whenever the user enters a new value. If the `mode` is USD, the component calculates the equivalent ether value based on the `price` prop and updates the `value` state accordingly. If the `mode` is ether, the component updates the `value` state directly. The `display` state is updated to reflect the new value of the input field, and the `onChange` callback is called with the new value if it is defined.\n\nOverall, the `EtherInput` component provides a simple way to display an input field for entering ether or USD amounts, with an option to convert between the two. It is flexible and customizable, with several props that can be used to specify the initial value, placeholder text, and other options. It is easy to use in a larger project by simply importing the component and passing the appropriate props. For example:\n\n```\nimport EtherInput from 'zoo/EtherInput';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [amount, setAmount] = useState(0);\n  const price = 200; // current price of ether in USD\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <EtherInput\n        autoFocus\n        price={price}\n        value={amount}\n        placeholder=\"Enter amount\"\n        onChange={value => {\n          setAmount(value);\n        }}\n      />\n      <p>Current amount: {amount} ETH</p>\n      <p>Current value: ${amount * price}</p>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useState` hooks in this code?\n- The `useState` hooks are used to manage the state of `mode`, `display`, and `value` variables in the component.\n\n2. How does the code handle conversion between USD and ETH?\n- The code provides an option to convert between USD and ETH by clicking on the displayed currency symbol. When the currency is changed, the `display` state is updated with the converted value if it exists.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?\n- The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `display` state when the `currentValue` changes. If `currentValue` is undefined, the `display` state is set to an empty string.",
