  "summary": "## GasGauge Code Explanation\n\nThe `GasGauge` code is a React component that displays a gas gauge. The component is imported from the `antd` library and React. The purpose of this code is to display a gas gauge that shows the current gas price. \n\nThe component takes in a single prop, `gasPrice`, which is used to display the current gas gauge. If `gasPrice` is not provided, the component will display 0 instead of NaN. \n\nTo use the `GasGauge` component, simply import it and include it in your React code. The component can be used as follows:\n\n```jsx\n<GasGauge gasPrice={gasPrice} />\n```\n\nThe `GasGauge` component is a button that, when clicked, opens a new window to the `ethgasstation.info` website. The button is styled with a large size and a round shape. The button also includes an icon of a fuel pump, represented by the `⛽️` emoji. \n\nThe gas price is displayed next to the fuel pump icon. If `gasPrice` is undefined, the component will display 0. Otherwise, the gas price is parsed as an integer and divided by 10 to the power of 9 to convert it to gwei. The gas price is then displayed with a `g` suffix. \n\nOverall, the `GasGauge` component is a simple and useful way to display the current gas price in a React application.",
