  "summary": "The `Ramp` component is a React component that displays the current price of Ethereum (ETH) and provides options to buy ETH through various services or get testnet ETH. The component uses the `RampInstantSDK` to open Ramp directly in the application. \n\nTo use the `Ramp` component, you can import it and include it in your React application like this:\n\n```\n<Ramp\n  price={price}\n  address={address}\n/>\n```\n\nThe `price` prop is optional and can be used to display the current ETH price. The `address` prop is also optional and can be used to paste your address into Wyre/Ramp instantly.\n\nThe `Ramp` component renders a button that displays the current ETH price and opens a modal when clicked. The modal displays options to buy ETH through Wyre, Ramp, or Coinbase, or get testnet ETH. The buttons for each service are styled with the `antd` library and include icons and flags to indicate the service and country. \n\nThe `Ramp` component also includes a loop that generates buttons for each testnet faucet provided in the `props.networks` object. The loop filters out the Rinkeby, Ropsten, Kovan, and Goerli testnets and generates a button for each remaining testnet. \n\nOverall, the `Ramp` component provides a convenient way for users to buy ETH or get testnet ETH directly within the application.",
