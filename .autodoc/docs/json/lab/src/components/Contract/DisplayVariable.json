  "summary": "The `DisplayVariable` component is a React component that displays the value of a smart contract function and provides a way to refresh the value. It takes in several props, including `contractFunction`, which is a function that returns the value of a smart contract function, `functionInfo`, which contains information about the smart contract function, `refreshRequired`, which is a boolean that indicates whether the component needs to be refreshed, and `triggerRefresh`, which is a function that triggers a refresh of the component.\n\nThe component uses the `useState` hook to store the value of the smart contract function, and the `useCallback` hook to define a function that refreshes the value of the smart contract function. The `useEffect` hook is used to call the refresh function when the component mounts, when the `refreshRequired` prop changes, or when the `contractFunction` prop changes.\n\nThe component renders a row with three columns. The first column displays the name of the smart contract function, the second column displays the value of the smart contract function, and the third column displays a refresh button. The `tryToDisplay` function is used to format the value of the smart contract function for display.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that interacts with a smart contract. It provides a simple way to display the value of a smart contract function and refresh it when necessary. Here is an example of how this component could be used:\n\n```\nimport DisplayVariable from \"./DisplayVariable\";\n\nconst MyComponent = ({ myContract }) => {\n  const [refreshRequired, setRefreshRequired] = useState(false);\n\n  const refresh = () => {\n    setRefreshRequired(true);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <DisplayVariable\n        contractFunction={myContract.methods.getMyValue}\n        functionInfo={{ name: \"My Value\" }}\n        refreshRequired={refreshRequired}\n        triggerRefresh={setRefreshRequired}\n      />\n      <button onClick={refresh}>Refresh</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyComponent` displays the value of a smart contract function called `getMyValue` and provides a refresh button. The `refresh` function updates the `refreshRequired` state, which triggers a refresh of the `DisplayVariable` component.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `tryToDisplay` function imported from `./utils`?\n   - The `tryToDisplay` function is used to format the display of the `variable` state value in the returned JSX.\n2. What is the purpose of the `refreshRequired` and `triggerRefresh` props passed to the component?\n   - The `refreshRequired` prop is used to trigger a refresh of the displayed variable when it changes, and the `triggerRefresh` prop is a function that sets the `refreshRequired` state value to `true`.\n3. What is the purpose of the `Divider` component from `antd` used in the returned JSX?\n   - The `Divider` component is used to visually separate the displayed variable from other components on the page.",
