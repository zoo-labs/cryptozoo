  "summary": "The `FunctionForm` component is a React component that renders a form for interacting with a smart contract function. It takes in several props, including `contractFunction`, which is the function to be called, `functionInfo`, which contains information about the function, `provider`, which is the Ethereum provider to use, `gasPrice`, which is the gas price to use for the transaction, and `triggerRefresh`, which is a function to trigger a refresh of the component.\n\nThe component uses the Ant Design library to render the form elements, including `Input`, `Button`, `Col`, `Row`, and `Divider`. It also uses the `react-blockies` library to render a blockie for an Ethereum address.\n\nThe form is dynamically generated based on the inputs of the function. For each input, an `Input` element is rendered with a suffix that provides additional functionality based on the type of the input. For example, if the input is of type `bytes32`, a button is rendered that allows the user to convert the input to a bytes32 string. If the input is of type `uint256`, a button is rendered that allows the user to convert the input to wei.\n\nIf the function is payable, an additional `Input` element is rendered for the transaction value.\n\nWhen the user clicks the button to call the function, the component constructs the arguments for the function based on the values in the form inputs, and then calls the function using the `contractFunction` and `tx` functions. If the function is a read-only function, the result is displayed in the form. If the function is a transaction, the transaction is sent and the user is prompted to confirm the transaction in their wallet.\n\nOverall, the `FunctionForm` component provides a convenient way for users to interact with smart contract functions in a user-friendly way. It abstracts away many of the details of interacting with the Ethereum network and provides a simple interface for users to input values and call functions.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Transactor` function and how is it used in this code?\n- The `Transactor` function is used to create a transaction object that can be used to send transactions to the Ethereum network. It takes in the `provider` and `gasPrice` as arguments and returns a function that can be used to send transactions.\n2. What is the purpose of the `tryToDisplay` function and where is it used in this code?\n- The `tryToDisplay` function is used to convert the return value of a contract function into a human-readable format. It is used in the `onClick` event of the button to display the return value of the contract function.\n3. What is the purpose of the `inputs` array and how is it populated?\n- The `inputs` array is used to store the input fields for the contract function. It is populated by mapping over the `functionInfo.inputs` array and creating an input field for each input. The input fields are then pushed into the `inputs` array.",
