  "summary": "The `TokenBalance` function in the `zoo` project is a React component that displays the balance of a specified token. The component takes in several props, including the name and address of the token contract, as well as an optional balance and dollar multiplier. \n\nThe function first uses the `useTokenBalance` hook from the `eth-hooks` library to retrieve the current balance of the token. It then converts the balance to a float and formats it to two decimal places. If a balance prop is provided, it uses that instead of the retrieved balance. \n\nIf a dollar multiplier prop is provided and the component is in dollar mode (which is the default), it multiplies the balance by the dollar multiplier and formats it to two decimal places with a dollar sign. Otherwise, it simply displays the balance with four decimal places. \n\nThe component returns a span element that displays the token balance along with an optional image prop. The span element is also clickable, toggling between dollar mode and regular mode when clicked. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to display the balance of a specific token in a user's wallet or in a trading interface. It provides a simple and customizable way to display token balances with the option to toggle between different display modes. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\n<TokenBalance\n  name=\"ZOO\"\n  address=\"0x123abc...\"\n  balance=\"1000000000000000000\"\n  dollarMultiplier={0.5}\n  img={<img src=\"zoo.png\" alt=\"ZOO\" />}\n/>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useTokenBalance` function imported from \"eth-hooks\"?\n- The `useTokenBalance` function is used to retrieve the balance of a specific token contract associated with a given address.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `1777` parameter passed to the `useTokenBalance` function?\n- The `1777` parameter is used as the chain ID for the Ethereum network, which is necessary for retrieving the correct token balance.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `dollarMultiplier` prop and how is it used in the code?\n- The `dollarMultiplier` prop is used to convert the token balance into a dollar value, and is multiplied by the float balance to get the dollar amount. If `dollarMode` is true, the dollar value is displayed instead of the token balance.",
