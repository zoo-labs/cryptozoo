  "summary": "The `Wallet` component is a React component that displays a wallet where users can specify an address and send USD/ETH. The component provides options to scan an address, convert between USD and ETH, see and generate private keys, and send, receive, and extract the burner wallet. \n\nThe component imports several dependencies from the `antd` and `@ant-design/icons` libraries, including `Button`, `Modal`, `Spin`, `Tooltip`, `Typography`, and several icons. It also imports `ethers` and `qrcode.react` libraries, as well as several helper components, including `Address`, `AddressInput`, `Balance`, and `EtherInput`.\n\nThe `Wallet` component takes several props, including `provider`, `address`, `ensProvider`, `price`, and `color`. Users can provide a `provider` prop to display a wallet, an `address` prop to specify an address, and an `ensProvider` prop to replace an address with an ENS name. Users can also provide a `price` prop to specify the price of ether and easily convert between USD and ETH, and a `color` prop to specify the color of the wallet icon.\n\nThe `Wallet` component uses several state variables, including `signerAddress`, `open`, `qr`, `amount`, `toAddress`, and `pk`. The component uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks to manage state and update the UI.\n\nThe `Wallet` component renders a wallet icon that users can click to open the wallet. The component also renders a `Modal` component that displays the wallet UI. The UI changes depending on the state of the component. If `qr` is true, the UI displays a QR code for the selected address. If `pk` is true, the UI displays the private key for the selected address. If neither `qr` nor `pk` is true, the UI displays input fields for the amount and address.\n\nThe `Wallet` component also renders several buttons, including a button to hide the QR code or private key, a button to receive funds, and a button to send funds. The component uses the `Transactor` helper function to send transactions. \n\nOverall, the `Wallet` component provides a user-friendly interface for sending and receiving funds and managing private keys. It can be used as a standalone component or integrated into a larger project.",
