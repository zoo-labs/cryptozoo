  "summary": "This code imports a package called `@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect` which adds custom matchers to Jest for asserting on DOM nodes. This allows developers to write more specific and targeted tests for their web applications. \n\nThe `toHaveTextContent` matcher mentioned in the code example is just one of the many matchers that are added by this package. It allows developers to check if a particular element has a certain text content. For example, if we have a button with the text \"Click me\", we can use this matcher to ensure that the button has the correct text content:\n\n```javascript\ntest(\"button has correct text content\", () => {\n  const button = document.querySelector(\"button\");\n  expect(button).toHaveTextContent(\"Click me\");\n});\n```\n\nThis code is likely part of a larger testing suite for the `zoo` project, which may include other packages and tools for testing. By using custom matchers like those provided by `jest-dom`, developers can write more expressive and readable tests that are easier to maintain and debug.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   Answer: This code imports \"@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect\" which adds custom jest matchers for asserting on DOM nodes.\n\n2.
