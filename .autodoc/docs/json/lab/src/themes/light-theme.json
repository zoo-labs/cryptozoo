  "summary": "This code is responsible for importing and defining the styling for the zoo project using the Ant Design library. The first three lines import the necessary Ant Design styling files, including the default theme. \n\nThe code then defines a shared variable for the border radius base, which can be used throughout the project. This variable is set to 4 pixels. \n\nFinally, the code defines a CSS class called \"highlight\" which sets the background color to a light gray. This class can be used to highlight certain elements on the page, such as search results or important information. \n\nOverall, this code sets up the basic styling for the zoo project using Ant Design, and provides a shared variable and CSS class that can be used throughout the project. \n\nExample usage of the \"highlight\" class:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"highlight\">\n  <p>This text is highlighted</p>\n</div>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the imported LESS files?\n   - The imported LESS files are used to style the components of the `antd` library, which is likely being used in the `zoo` project.\n\n2. Why are there shared variables commented out?\n   - The shared variables are likely commented out because they have been extracted to their own file for easier management and organization.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `.highlight` class?\n   - The `.highlight` class is used to apply a specific background color to elements that need to be highlighted in the UI.",
