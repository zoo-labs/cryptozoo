  "summary": "This code is responsible for importing and defining the styling variables for the zoo project's user interface. The code imports the necessary styling files from the Ant Design library, which is a popular UI library for React applications. \n\nThe first three lines of the code import the color palette, the main Ant Design styling file, and the dark theme styling file. These files provide the base styling for the project. \n\nThe remaining lines define the shared variables that can be used throughout the project. These variables include the primary color, border radius, and various background and border colors. These variables can be used to maintain consistency in the project's styling. \n\nThe `.highlight` class is also defined in this file, which sets the background color to a dark gray color. This class can be used to highlight certain elements in the UI. \n\nOverall, this code sets up the necessary styling variables and imports the base styling for the zoo project's UI. These variables and styles can be used throughout the project to maintain consistency and provide a cohesive look and feel. \n\nExample usage of the `@primary-color` variable:\n\n```css\n.button {\n  background-color: @primary-color;\n  color: white;\n  border-radius: @border-radius-base;\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `@import` statements at the beginning of the code?\n   \n   The `@import` statements are importing styles from the Ant Design library, specifically the color palette, the main Ant Design styles, and a dark theme.\n\n2. What are the shared variables defined in this file and why might they be useful?\n   \n   The shared variables defined in this file include `@primary-color`, `@border-radius-base`, and several others that define colors and styles used throughout the project. They are useful for maintaining consistency and making it easy to update styles across the project.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `.highlight` class and where is it used?\n   \n   The `.highlight` class defines a background color of `#3f3f3f`. It is not used anywhere in this file, but it may be used in other files or in the project's JavaScript code to highlight certain elements.",
