  "summary": "This code exports a series of custom React hooks from various files within the `zoo` project. These hooks are designed to provide functionality for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts and other blockchain-related tasks.\n\nFor example, the `useContractLoader` hook can be used to load a smart contract from its address on the blockchain, while the `useContractReader` hook can be used to read data from a smart contract. The `useGasPrice` hook provides the current gas price for transactions on the Ethereum network, and the `useResolveName` hook can be used to resolve an Ethereum address to its corresponding ENS name.\n\nThese hooks can be imported and used in other parts of the `zoo` project to simplify the process of interacting with the blockchain. For example, a component that needs to read data from a smart contract can use the `useContractReader` hook to do so without having to write custom code to interact with the contract.\n\nHere is an example of how the `useGasPrice` hook could be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport { useGasPrice } from 'zoo';\n\nfunction GasPriceDisplay() {\n  const gasPrice = useGasPrice();\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      Current gas price: {gasPrice} wei\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nOverall, this code provides a set of reusable hooks that can be used throughout the `zoo` project to simplify interactions with the Ethereum blockchain.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file exports various custom hooks from different files within the `zoo` project.\n\n2. What are some examples of the custom hooks being exported?\n- Some examples of the custom hooks being exported include `useBalance`, `useContractLoader`, `useLocalStorage`, and `useUserSigner`.\n\n3. How can a developer use these custom hooks in their own code?\n- A developer can import the desired custom hook from this file and use it in their own code by calling the hook function and passing in any necessary parameters.",
