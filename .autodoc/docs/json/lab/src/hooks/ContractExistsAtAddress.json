  "summary": "## Code Explanation: `useContractExistsAtAddress`\n\nThe `useContractExistsAtAddress` function is a custom React hook that checks whether a smart contract exists on the blockchain. It takes two parameters: `provider` and `contractAddress`. `provider` is an object that represents the Ethereum provider (e.g. `localProvider`, `mainnetProvider`, etc.) and `contractAddress` is the address of the smart contract that we want to check.\n\nThe function uses the `useState` hook to create a state variable called `contractIsDeployed` and initializes it to `false`. This variable will be used to store the result of the contract existence check.\n\nThe function also uses the `useEffect` hook to perform the contract existence check. The `useEffect` hook is called whenever the `provider` or `contractAddress` parameters change. Inside the hook, the function first checks if the `contractAddress` is a valid Ethereum address using the `isAddress` function from the `ethers` library. If the address is invalid, the function returns `false`.\n\nIf the address is valid, the function uses the `getCode` method of the `provider` object to retrieve the bytecode stored at the `contractAddress`. If the bytecode is not equal to `0x0`, then a contract exists at that address and the `contractIsDeployed` state variable is set to `true`.\n\nFinally, the function returns the `contractIsDeployed` state variable.\n\n## How to Use\n\nTo use the `useContractExistsAtAddress` hook, you can import it from the `zoo` module and call it in your React component. Here's an example:\n\n```javascript\nimport useContractExistsAtAddress from 'zoo';\n\nfunction MyComponent({ provider, contractAddress }) {\n  const contractIsDeployed = useContractExistsAtAddress(provider, contractAddress);\n\n  // Use the contractIsDeployed variable to conditionally render content\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {contractIsDeployed ? <p>Contract is deployed!</p> : <p>Contract is not deployed.</p>}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, we pass in the `provider` and `contractAddress` variables as props to the `MyComponent` function. We then call the `useContractExistsAtAddress` hook with these variables to get the `contractIsDeployed` result. We can then use this result to conditionally render content based on whether the contract exists or not.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ethers` and `react` imports?\n- The `ethers` import is used to access the `getCode` function to check if a contract exists at a given address, while the `react` import is used to define a custom React hook.\n    \n2. How does the `useContractExistsAtAddress` function determine if a contract is deployed?\n- The function checks the bytecode stored at the provided contract address using the `getCode` function from the `provider` object. If the bytecode is not equal to \"0x0\", then a contract is deployed at that address.\n    \n3. Can this function be used to check for contract existence on different blockchain networks?\n- Yes, the function can be used to check for contract existence on different blockchain networks by changing the `provider` object passed as an argument to the function. For example, passing a `mainnetProvider` object would check for contract existence on the Ethereum mainnet.",
