  "summary": "This code defines a set of constants and objects related to various blockchain networks. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for storing network information that can be used throughout the larger project. \n\nThe code defines several constants, including `INFURA_ID`, `ETHERSCAN_KEY`, and `BLOCKNATIVE_DAPPID`, which are API keys for various blockchain services. It also defines an object called `NETWORKS`, which contains information about various blockchain networks, including their name, color, chain ID, RPC URL, block explorer URL, and faucet URL. \n\nThe `NETWORK` function takes a `chainId` parameter and returns the corresponding network object from the `NETWORKS` object. This function can be used to retrieve network information based on the chain ID, which is a unique identifier for each blockchain network. \n\nOverall, this code provides a convenient way to store and access network information for various blockchain networks. It can be used throughout the larger project to interact with different networks and services. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { NETWORK, NETWORKS } from 'zoo';\n\nconst network = NETWORK(56); // returns the mainnet network object\nconsole.log(network.name); // logs \"mainnet\"\n\nconst networks = Object.values(NETWORKS); // returns an array of all network objects\nconsole.log(networks.length); // logs the number of networks defined in the object\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code file?\n- This code file defines constants and objects related to various blockchain networks, including their names, chain IDs, RPC URLs, block explorers, and gas prices.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `INFURA_ID`, `ETHERSCAN_KEY`, and `BLOCKNATIVE_DAPPID` constants?\n- `INFURA_ID` is a unique identifier used to access the Infura API for Ethereum nodes. `ETHERSCAN_KEY` is an API key used to access the Etherscan API for blockchain data. `BLOCKNATIVE_DAPPID` is an ID used to integrate with the Blocknative Notify.js library for transaction notifications.\n\n3. How can a developer use the `NETWORK` function?\n- The `NETWORK` function takes a `chainId` parameter and returns an object containing information about the corresponding blockchain network, such as its name, color, and RPC URL. This can be useful for dynamically selecting network-specific settings and endpoints in a decentralized application.",
