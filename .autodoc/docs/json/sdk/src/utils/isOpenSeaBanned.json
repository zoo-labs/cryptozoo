  "summary": "The `isOpenSeaBanned` function in this code file checks whether a given array of token ids are banned on OpenSea, a popular NFT marketplace. The function takes in an array of token ids as a parameter and returns a dictionary of token banned status from OpenSea. \n\nThe function first constructs a URL to query the OpenSea API for each token id in the input array. It does this by iterating over each token id, splitting it into its contract and token id components, and appending these components to the URL. The resulting URL is then used to make a GET request to the OpenSea API using the `axios` library. \n\nThe response from the OpenSea API is then processed to determine the banned status of each token. The function extracts the current chain from the `getClient` function and constructs a base API URL using the chain's API key. It then iterates over each asset in the OpenSea API response and sets the banned status of the corresponding token in a dictionary. The banned status is determined by checking whether the asset supports the Wyvern protocol, which is used for trading on OpenSea. If the asset does not support Wyvern, it is considered banned. \n\nFinally, the function sends a POST request to a Reservoir API endpoint for each token to update its banned status. The API endpoint is constructed using the base API URL and the Reservoir API key for the current chain. The function constructs a JSON body containing the token id and its banned status, and sends it in the POST request. The function also includes some headers in the POST request, including the version of the code (`version`) and the version of the Reservoir UI (`client.uiVersion`). \n\nOverall, this function is useful for checking whether a given array of tokens are banned on OpenSea and updating their banned status on Reservoir. It can be used in a larger project that involves trading or managing NFTs on OpenSea and Reservoir. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst bannedTokens = await isOpenSeaBanned([\"123:0xabc123\", \"456:0xdef456\"])\nconsole.log(bannedTokens) // { \"0xabc123:123\": true, \"0xdef456:456\": false }\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code checks if tokens are banned on OpenSea by making API requests to OpenSea and then sends a POST request to a specified API endpoint with the status of each token.\n\n2. What is the input to the `isOpenSeaBanned` function and what is the output?\n    \n    The input to the `isOpenSeaBanned` function is an array of token ids. The output is a dictionary of token banned status from OpenSea.\n\n3. What external dependencies does this code rely on?\n    \n    This code relies on the `axios` library for making HTTP requests, the `AxiosRequestHeaders` interface from the `axios` library for defining headers for HTTP requests, the `getClient` function from another file for getting a client object, and the `version` property from the `package.json` file for setting the `x-rkc-version` header.",
