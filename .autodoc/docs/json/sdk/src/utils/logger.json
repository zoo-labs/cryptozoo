  "summary": "The code above defines an enum called `LogLevel` that represents different levels of logging. The levels are `Verbose`, `Info`, `Warn`, `Error`, and `None`, with `Verbose` being the highest level of logging and `None` being the lowest. \n\nThe code also exports a function called `log` that takes in three parameters: an array of `params`, a `level` of type `LogLevel`, and a `currentLevel` of type `LogLevel`. The `log` function checks if the `currentLevel` is greater than or equal to the `level` passed in as a parameter. If it is, the function logs the `params` array to the console at the appropriate level. \n\nFor example, if the `level` passed in is `LogLevel.Info`, the `log` function will log the `params` array to the console using `console.info()`. If the `level` passed in is `LogLevel.Error`, the `log` function will log the `params` array to the console using `console.error()`. If the `level` passed in is `LogLevel.Warn`, the `log` function will log the `params` array to the console using `console.warn()`. If the `level` passed in is any other level, the `log` function will log the `params` array to the console using `console.log()`.\n\nThis code can be used to log information at different levels of severity throughout the project. For example, if the project has a debugging mode, the `LogLevel.Verbose` level can be used to log detailed information that would not be logged in production. On the other hand, if the project is in production, the `LogLevel.Error` level can be used to log critical errors that need to be addressed immediately. \n\nHere is an example of how the `log` function can be used in the project:\n\n```\nimport { log, LogLevel } from 'zoo';\n\nconst currentLogLevel = LogLevel.Verbose;\n\nlog(['This is a verbose log message'], LogLevel.Verbose, currentLogLevel);\nlog(['This is an info log message'], LogLevel.Info, currentLogLevel);\nlog(['This is a warning log message'], LogLevel.Warn, currentLogLevel);\nlog(['This is an error log message'], LogLevel.Error, currentLogLevel);\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `log` function is called four times with different levels of logging. The `currentLogLevel` variable is set to `LogLevel.Verbose`, so all four log messages will be logged to the console. If `currentLogLevel` was set to `LogLevel.Warn`, only the warning and error messages would be logged to the console.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `LogLevel` enum?\n- The `LogLevel` enum is used to define different levels of logging, from most verbose to least verbose.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `log` function?\n- The `log` function is used to log messages to the console, based on the specified log level and the current log level.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `params` parameter in the `log` function?\n- The `params` parameter is an array of values to be logged, which can include any number of arguments. The function will concatenate these values and log them to the console.",
