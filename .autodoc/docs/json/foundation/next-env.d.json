  "summary": "This file is a configuration file for the Next.js framework, which is used in the larger zoo project. The file includes two reference types, \"next\" and \"next/image-types/global\", which are used to provide type definitions for the Next.js framework and its image handling capabilities. \n\nThe purpose of this file is to ensure that the project is properly configured to use TypeScript with Next.js. The comments in the file indicate that it should not be edited, and instead developers should refer to the Next.js documentation for more information on how to configure TypeScript with the framework. \n\nOverall, this file is a small but important piece of the larger zoo project, as it ensures that the project is properly configured to use TypeScript with Next.js. Without this configuration, the project may encounter errors or inconsistencies in its codebase. \n\nExample usage of this file in the larger project could include importing the reference types in other TypeScript files to provide type definitions for Next.js components and functions. For example, a developer may import the \"next\" reference type in a file that defines a Next.js page component, like so:\n\n```typescript\nimport { NextPage } from 'next';\n\nconst MyPage: NextPage = () => {\n  // page component code here\n}\n\nexport default MyPage;\n```\n\nBy importing the \"next\" reference type, the developer can ensure that the \"NextPage\" type is properly defined and used in the component. This helps to prevent errors and improve the overall maintainability of the codebase.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the \"reference types\" comments at the top of the file?\n   - These comments are used to reference external type definitions for the Next.js framework and its image types.\n\n2. Why is there a \"NOTE\" comment stating that the file should not be edited?\n   - This comment is a warning to developers that editing this file may cause issues with the Next.js framework and its TypeScript integration.\n\n3. Where can developers find more information about using TypeScript with Next.js?\n   - The comment provides a link to the Next.js documentation, which contains more information about using TypeScript with the framework.",
