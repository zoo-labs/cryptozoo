  "summary": "This code is importing the `extend-expect` module from the `@testing-library/jest-dom` package. This module provides additional matchers for Jest, a popular JavaScript testing framework. These matchers allow for more specific and readable assertions in tests.\n\nThe code also includes a comment that disables the eslint rule for an undefined variable. This is likely because the `no-undef` rule is triggered by the `jest.mock` function call on the next line.\n\nThe `jest.mock` function call is used to mock the `next/router` module. This is likely done to allow for easier testing of components that use the Next.js router. The `require` call is used to import the `next-router-mock` package, which provides a mock implementation of the Next.js router.\n\nOverall, this code is used to set up the testing environment for the Zoo project. By importing the `extend-expect` module and mocking the Next.js router, tests can be written and run with more ease and accuracy. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';\nimport MyComponent from './MyComponent';\n\ndescribe('MyComponent', () => {\n  it('renders correctly', () => {\n    render(<MyComponent />);\n    expect(screen.getByText('Hello, world!')).toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nIn this example, the `render` function from `@testing-library/react` is used to render the `MyComponent` component. The `screen.getByText` function is then used to assert that the component renders the text \"Hello, world!\". The `extend-expect` module allows for the use of the `toBeInTheDocument` matcher, which makes this assertion more readable and specific. The mocked Next.js router allows for testing of components that rely on router functionality without actually navigating to different pages.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of importing '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect'?\n- This import allows the use of additional matchers for Jest tests.\n\n2. Why is there a comment disabling eslint for the router mock?\n- The router mock is likely triggering an eslint rule, so the comment disables the rule for that specific line of code.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the router mock and how does it work?\n- The router mock is used to simulate the behavior of the Next.js router in Jest tests. It works by replacing the actual router with a mock implementation that can be controlled in tests.",
