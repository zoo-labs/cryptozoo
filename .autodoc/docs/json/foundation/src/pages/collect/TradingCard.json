  "summary": "The `TradingCard` function in this file is responsible for rendering a trading card component on a web page. The component includes an image of a trading card, a title, and a description. The purpose of this component is to provide users with a visual representation of the trading cards available on the website and encourage them to explore and learn more about the animals featured on the cards.\n\nThe component is built using the Next.js framework and includes two imported modules: `Image` and `Link`. The `Image` module is used to display the image of the trading card, while the `Link` module is used to create a link to the page where users can view all of the trading cards available on the website.\n\nThe component is structured using HTML-like syntax, with the `className` attribute used to apply CSS classes to the various elements. The `div` element with the class `bg-black` sets the background color of the component to black, while the `h1` element with the class `text-white` sets the color of the text to white.\n\nThe `Image` component is used to display the image of the trading card. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image file, while the `width` and `height` attributes set the dimensions of the image. The `alt` attribute is left blank, indicating that the image is purely decorative and does not require an alternative text description.\n\nThe `Link` component is used to create a link to the page where users can view all of the trading cards available on the website. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page, while the `className` attribute applies CSS classes to the link. The link includes a text label and an SVG icon, which are styled using CSS.\n\nOverall, the `TradingCard` component is a simple but effective way to showcase the trading cards available on the website and encourage users to explore and learn more about the animals featured on the cards. It can be easily integrated into the larger project by importing and rendering the component wherever trading cards are displayed. For example:\n\n```\nimport TradingCard from './TradingCard';\n\nfunction TradingCardPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Trading Cards</h1>\n      <TradingCard />\n      <TradingCard />\n      <TradingCard />\n      <Link href='/collect'>View All Cards</Link>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default TradingCardPage;\n```",
