  "summary": "The `Header` function in this code file is responsible for rendering the header section of the zoo website. It imports two components from the Next.js library, `Link` and `Image`, which are used to create links to different animal pages and display an image of an elephant, respectively. \n\nThe header is contained within a `div` element with a black background color. The header is divided into two sections, which are aligned vertically on smaller screens and horizontally on larger screens. The first section contains a heading that reads \"Animals we support.\" The heading is styled with white text and is responsive, changing size based on the screen size. The second section contains an image of an elephant and a list of links to different animal pages. \n\nThe list of links is created using the `Link` component from Next.js. Each link is styled with white text and has a hover effect. When clicked, the link takes the user to a different page on the website that contains information about the animal. The links are hardcoded in the `Header` function, but they could be generated dynamically based on data from a database or API. \n\nThe `Image` component is used to display an image of an elephant on the right side of the header. The image is responsive and changes size based on the screen size. The `src` attribute specifies the path to the image file, which is located in the `public/images` directory. The `width` and `height` attributes specify the dimensions of the image in pixels. \n\nOverall, the `Header` function is an important component of the zoo website that provides users with easy access to information about different animals. It is responsive and visually appealing, with a black background, white text, and an image of an elephant. The links to different animal pages are hardcoded, but could be generated dynamically based on data from a database or API.",
