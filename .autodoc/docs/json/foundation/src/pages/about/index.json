  "summary": "This code defines the homepage of the Zoo Labs Foundation website using React. The purpose of this code is to render the various components that make up the homepage of the website. \n\nThe code imports several components from the `@/components` directory, including `Layout`, `Intro`, `Seo`, `Navbar`, `Principles`, `Donation`, `OurEfforts`, `Safeguard`, `StartCollecting`, `Newsletter`, and `Footer`. These components are then rendered in the `return` statement of the `HomePage` function.\n\nThe `Layout` component is the outermost component that provides the basic structure of the page. The `Seo` component provides metadata for search engines. The `Navbar` component is the navigation bar at the top of the page. The `Intro` component provides an introduction to the Zoo Labs Foundation and its mission. The `OurEfforts` component showcases the foundation's ongoing efforts to preserve wildlife. The `Principles` component outlines the foundation's guiding principles. The `Donation` component provides a way for users to donate to the foundation. The `Safeguard` component provides information on how the foundation safeguards wildlife. The `StartCollecting` component provides a way for users to start collecting donations. The `Newsletter` component provides a way for users to sign up for the foundation's newsletter. The `Footer` component is the footer of the page.\n\nThe code also includes conditional rendering based on screen size. The `StartCollecting` and `Safeguard` components are rendered differently depending on whether the screen size is larger or smaller than a certain threshold.\n\nOverall, this code defines the homepage of the Zoo Labs Foundation website and renders the various components that make up the page. It provides users with information on the foundation's mission, ongoing efforts, guiding principles, and ways to donate and get involved.",
