  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `NotFoundPage` that renders a custom 404 error page for a web application. The component imports several other components and icons from the project's codebase, including `Layout`, `ArrowLink`, and `Seo`, as well as the `RiAlarmWarningFill` icon from the `react-icons/ri` library.\n\nWhen the `NotFoundPage` component is rendered, it returns a JSX template that includes the imported components and icon. The `Layout` component provides a consistent layout for the page, while the `Seo` component sets the page's metadata, including the title. The `ArrowLink` component renders a link to the home page of the application.\n\nThe main content of the page is contained within a `section` element with a white background. The content is centered vertically and horizontally using flexbox, and includes the `RiAlarmWarningFill` icon, which is animated to flicker and has a red color. The icon is followed by a heading that reads \"Page Not Found\" in large text, and a link to the home page of the application.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger web application to provide a custom 404 error page that matches the application's branding and design. The `NotFoundPage` component can be imported and used in a routing system to handle requests for pages that do not exist. For example, in a Next.js application, the `NotFoundPage` component could be used as the fallback page for undefined routes by defining a custom 404 page in the `pages/404.js` file:\n\n```javascript\nimport NotFoundPage from '@/components/NotFoundPage';\n\nexport default function Custom404() {\n  return <NotFoundPage />;\n}\n```\n\nOverall, this code demonstrates how React components can be used to create reusable UI elements that can be easily integrated into a larger web application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Layout` component being imported?\n- The `Layout` component is likely a wrapper component that provides a consistent layout for all pages in the project.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Seo` component being imported?\n- The `Seo` component is likely used to set metadata for the page, such as the title and description that appear in search engine results.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `ArrowLink` component being imported?\n- The `ArrowLink` component is likely a custom link component that includes an arrow icon, used for navigation within the project.",
