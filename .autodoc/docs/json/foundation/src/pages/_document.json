  "summary": "This code is a React component that exports a default function called `Document`. It is used in the Next.js framework to create a custom `Document` page that is rendered on the server-side and sent to the client as HTML. The purpose of this code is to provide a basic HTML structure for the `Document` page and to include some additional elements, such as a font file and a `Main` component.\n\nThe `Document` component returns an HTML document that includes a `Head` component and a `body` component. The `Head` component contains a `link` element that preloads a font file called `inter-var-latin.woff2`. This font file is specified with the `href` attribute and its type is set to `font/woff2`. The `as` attribute is set to `font`, which tells the browser to treat this file as a font file and to prioritize its loading. The `crossOrigin` attribute is set to `anonymous`, which allows the font file to be loaded from a different domain.\n\nThe `body` component contains a `Main` component and a `NextScript` component. The `Main` component is a placeholder for the main content of the page, which will be rendered by the Next.js framework. The `NextScript` component includes scripts that are required for the page to function properly, such as the Next.js client-side JavaScript bundle.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to customize the `Document` page and to include additional elements that are required for the project. For example, if the project requires a specific font file, it can be included in the `Head` component using the same syntax as in this code. Additionally, if the project requires additional scripts or stylesheets, they can be included in the `Head` component as well.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport Document, { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document';\n\nexport default class MyDocument extends Document {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <Html lang='en' style={{scrollBehavior:'smooth'}}>\n        <Head>\n          <link\n            rel='preload'\n            href='/fonts/my-font.woff2'\n            as='font'\n            type='font/woff2'\n            crossOrigin='anonymous'\n          />\n          <link\n            rel='stylesheet'\n            href='/styles/my-styles.css'\n          />\n        </Head>\n        <body>\n          <Main />\n          <NextScript />\n        </body>\n      </Html>\n    );\n  }\n}\n``` \n\nIn this example, a custom `Document` component is created by extending the base `Document` class from Next.js. The `Head` component includes a custom font file called `my-font.woff2` and a custom stylesheet called `my-styles.css`. These files are located in the `public/fonts` and `public/styles` directories, respectively. The `Main` and `NextScript` components are included in the `body` component as before.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Document` function?\n- The `Document` function is used to define the structure of the HTML document that Next.js will generate.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `lang` attribute in the `Html` tag?\n- The `lang` attribute specifies the primary language of the document, which can be useful for accessibility and search engine optimization.\n\n3. Why is the `inter-var-latin.woff2` font being preloaded?\n- The `inter-var-latin.woff2` font is being preloaded to improve performance by ensuring that the font is available as soon as it is needed, rather than waiting for it to be downloaded when it is first used.",
