  "summary": "This code defines the homepage of the Zoo Labs Foundation website. The purpose of this code is to display the Privacy Policy of the organization. The code imports several components from the `@/components` directory, including `Layout`, `Seo`, `Navbar`, `Newsletter`, and `Footer`. These components are used to structure the page and provide additional functionality, such as search engine optimization and email newsletter subscription.\n\nThe `HomePage` function returns a JSX element that contains the imported components and the Privacy Policy content. The content is structured using HTML tags and CSS classes to define the layout and styling of the page. The Privacy Policy content is divided into sections that explain how the organization collects, uses, and protects personal information. The content also includes information about user rights and choices, as well as contact information for the organization.\n\nThis code can be used as a template for other pages on the Zoo Labs Foundation website. By importing and using the `Layout`, `Seo`, `Navbar`, `Newsletter`, and `Footer` components, other pages can be structured and styled consistently with the homepage. The Privacy Policy content can also be modified to create other legal documents, such as Terms of Service or a CCPA Privacy Notice for California Residents.\n\nHere is an example of how this code can be used to create a Terms of Service page:\n\n```\nimport * as React from 'react';\n\nimport Layout from '@/components/layout/Layout';\nimport Seo from '@/components/Seo';\nimport Navbar from '@/components/Navbar';\nimport Newsletter from '@/components/Newsletter';\nimport Footer from '@/components/Footer';\n\nexport default function TermsOfServicePage() {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n        <Seo title='Terms of Service' />\n        <Navbar />\n        <div className='flex flex-col bg-black space-y-12 md:px-32 max-md:px-4 md:pt-32 pt-16'>\n            <h1 className='text-white md:text-5xl xl:text-6xl max-md:text-3xl'>Terms of Service</h1>\n            <p className='text-white text-xl'>\n            This is the Terms of Service page for Zoo Labs Foundation.
