  "summary": "The `Ourefforts` function is a React component that renders a section of the zoo project's website. The purpose of this section is to showcase the conservation efforts that the zoo is undertaking to protect endangered species. The component imports the `Image` component from the `next/image` library, which is used to display icons for each conservation effort.\n\nThe component defines an array of objects called `efforts`, where each object represents a conservation effort. Each object has a `title` property, which is a string that describes the conservation effort, a `content` property, which is a string that provides more details about the effort, and an `icon` property, which is a string that specifies the path to the icon image for the effort.\n\nThe `efforts` array is then mapped over to create a grid of cards, where each card displays the icon, title, and content for a conservation effort. The `Image` component is used to display the icon for each effort, and the `title` and `content` properties are used to populate the text content of each card.\n\nThe component also includes some CSS classes to style the cards and their contents. The cards are displayed in a grid layout, with two columns on larger screens and one column on smaller screens. The text content of each card is displayed in a flexbox layout, with the title and content displayed in separate paragraphs.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger zoo project to showcase the conservation efforts that the zoo is undertaking. It provides a visually appealing and informative way to communicate the zoo's commitment to protecting endangered species. Here is an example of how this component might be used in the larger project:\n\n```\nimport Ourefforts from './Ourefforts';\n\nfunction ConservationPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Conservation Efforts</h1>\n      <Ourefforts />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default ConservationPage;\n```\n\nIn this example, the `ConservationPage` component renders a heading and the `Ourefforts` component, which displays the conservation efforts. This page could be linked to from the zoo's homepage or navigation menu to provide visitors with more information about the zoo's conservation efforts.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Image` import from 'next/image'?\n   - The `Image` import is used to display images in the component, with optimized performance and automatic optimization of image sizes and formats.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `efforts` array?\n   - The `efforts` array contains information about the conservation efforts for different endangered species, including their titles, descriptions, and icons.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `className` attributes in the JSX code?\n   - The `className` attributes are used to apply CSS classes to the HTML elements in the component, for styling and layout purposes.",
