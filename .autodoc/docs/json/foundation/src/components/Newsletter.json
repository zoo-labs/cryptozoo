  "summary": "The `Newsletter` function in the `zoo` project is responsible for rendering a newsletter subscription form on the website. The form is designed to collect the user's name and email address, and it also includes an image and some text to provide context and encourage users to subscribe.\n\nThe function uses the `Image` component from the `next/image` library to display an image of the newsletter. The image is sourced from the `/images/newsletter.png` file and is displayed with a width of 800 pixels and a height of 800 pixels. The `alt` attribute is left empty, which may not be ideal for accessibility purposes.\n\nThe rest of the function returns a `div` element that contains the newsletter subscription form. The form is styled using Tailwind CSS classes to create a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.\n\nThe form includes two input fields for the user's name and email address, respectively. The input fields are styled to match the rest of the form and are wrapped in `div` elements that include a label and a horizontal rule to separate the input fields.\n\nThe function also includes some text that describes the mission of the foundation and encourages users to subscribe to the newsletter for updates and progress reports.\n\nOverall, the `Newsletter` function is a simple component that can be easily integrated into other parts of the `zoo` project to provide a way for users to subscribe to the newsletter. Here is an example of how the component might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport Newsletter from './components/Newsletter';\n\nfunction HomePage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo!</h1>\n      <p>Learn about our mission and subscribe to our newsletter:</p>\n      <Newsletter />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
