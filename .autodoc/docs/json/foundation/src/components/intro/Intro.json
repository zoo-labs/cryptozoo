  "summary": "The `Intro` function in this code file is responsible for rendering the introductory section of a web page. It takes in three props: `breadcrumbs`, `title`, and `comment`. The `breadcrumbs` prop is a string that represents the navigation path to the current page. The `title` prop is a string that represents the main title of the page. The `comment` prop is an optional string that represents a short description of the page.\n\nThe function returns a JSX element that contains the introductory section of the page. The section has a black background and is divided into two parts: one for larger screens and one for smaller screens. The larger screen section contains a video of a giraffe and some text, while the smaller screen section contains an image of a jungle and some text.\n\nThe video in the larger screen section is set to autoplay and loop. It is sourced from a file called `Giraffe_teen.webm`. The text in the section is divided into three parts: the `breadcrumbs` prop, the `title` prop, and the `comment` prop. The `breadcrumbs` and `title` props are displayed as headings, while the `comment` prop is displayed as a paragraph. There is also a horizontal line that separates the `comment` prop from the rest of the text.\n\nThe image in the smaller screen section is sourced from a file called `intro_bg.png`. It is displayed on the right side of the section and takes up most of the available space. The text in the section is similar to the text in the larger screen section, but it is arranged differently. The `breadcrumbs` prop is displayed above the `title` prop, and the `comment` prop is displayed below the `title` prop.\n\nThis function is likely used in the larger project to provide a consistent and visually appealing introduction to each page. By passing in different values for the `breadcrumbs`, `title`, and `comment` props, the function can be used to create unique introductory sections for each page. For example, on a page about lions, the `title` prop might be \"Lions\" and the `comment` prop might be \"Learn about the king of the jungle and how you can help protect them\". The `breadcrumbs` prop might be \"Home > Animals > Lions\". This would create an introductory section that is specific to the lion page and provides useful information to the user.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Intro` function and what are its required and optional parameters?\n   \n   The `Intro` function is a React component that returns JSX for rendering an introductory section of the website. It requires `breadcrumbs` and `title` parameters, and has an optional `comment` parameter.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `Image` component from the `next/image` library and how is it used in this code?\n   \n   The `Image` component is used to display an image with optimized loading and resizing. In this code, it is used to display an image with the source `/images/intro_bg.png` and dimensions of 1000x1000 pixels.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `max-md` class and how is it used in this code?\n   \n   The `max-md` class is used to apply styles that only take effect when the screen width is less than or equal to the `md` breakpoint. It is used to adjust the layout and font sizes of certain elements for smaller screens.",
