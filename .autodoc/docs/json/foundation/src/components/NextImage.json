  "summary": "The code is a React component that wraps the Next.js Image component to provide additional functionality. The NextImage component accepts several props, including useSkeleton, imgClassName, blurClassName, alt, width, height, and ImageProps. The useSkeleton prop is a boolean that determines whether or not to add a background with a pulse animation. The imgClassName prop is a string that specifies the class name for the image. The blurClassName prop is a string that specifies the class name for the blur effect. The alt prop is a string that specifies the alt text for the image. The width and height props specify the dimensions of the image. The ImageProps prop is an object that contains additional props for the Next.js Image component.\n\nThe NextImage component renders a figure element that contains the Next.js Image component. If the width prop is not set, the figure element is given a width style that is equal to the width of the image. The Image component is given a className that is a combination of the imgClassName and blurClassName props. If the useSkeleton prop is true, the className also includes the animate-pulse class. The Image component is passed the src, width, height, alt, and rest props. The onLoadingComplete prop is used to set the status state to complete when the image has finished loading.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display images with additional functionality, such as a loading animation or a blur effect. Here is an example of how the NextImage component can be used:\n\n```\nimport NextImage from '@/components/NextImage';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <NextImage\n        src=\"/my-image.jpg\"\n        width={500}\n        height={500}\n        alt=\"My Image\"\n        useSkeleton={true}\n        imgClassName=\"my-image\"\n        blurClassName=\"my-blur\"\n      />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the NextImage component is used to display an image with a width and height of 500 pixels. The useSkeleton prop is set to true, which adds a background with a pulse animation. The imgClassName prop is set to \"my-image\", and the blurClassName prop is set to \"my-blur\". These class names can be used to style the image and the blur effect.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useSkeleton` prop?\n- The `useSkeleton` prop is used to add a background with pulse animation to the image, but should not be used if the image is transparent.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `widthIsSet` variable?\n- The `widthIsSet` variable is used to check if the `className` prop includes the `w-` class, which is used to set the width of the image.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `onLoadingComplete` prop?\n- The `onLoadingComplete` prop is used to set the status of the image to 'complete' once the image has finished loading.",
