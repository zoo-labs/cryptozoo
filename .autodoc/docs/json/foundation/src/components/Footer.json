  "summary": "The `Footer` component is responsible for rendering the footer section of the website. It contains two sections, one for larger screens and one for smaller screens. The larger screen section contains five columns, each with a different set of links. The first column contains links to the Zoo Foundation's social media pages, including Twitter, Telegram, Instagram, Discord, Medium, and YouTube. The second column contains links to pages about the Zoo Foundation, including the About page, Get Involved page, Donation page, Volunteer page, and Initiatives page. The third column contains links to pages about different animals, including the Red Wolf, Nubian Giraffe, Amur Leopard, and Sumatran Elephant. The fourth column contains links to pages about other animals, including the Javan Rhino, Pygmy Hippo, and Siberian Tiger. The fifth column contains links to the Zoo Foundation's Terms of Use, the zoolabs.io website, and the foundation's email address.\n\nThe smaller screen section contains fewer links and is more condensed. It contains links to the Home page, About page, Get Involved page, Collect page, and Donation page. It also contains links to the Zoo Foundation's social media pages.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project by importing it into other components and rendering it at the bottom of the page. For example, a `Layout` component could import the `Footer` component and render it after the main content of the page. This would ensure that the footer is consistent across all pages of the website.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport Footer from './Footer';\n\nfunction Layout(props) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Header />\n      <main>{props.children}</main>\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Layout;\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code defines a React component called `Footer` that renders the footer section of a website called Zoo Foundation.\n\n2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several icons from the `react-icons` library and a `Link` component from the `next/link` library.\n\n3. What is the layout and content of the footer section?\n- The footer section is divided into two parts: a visible section for larger screens and a hidden section for smaller screens. Both sections contain links to various pages on the website, as well as links to the Zoo Foundation's social media accounts. The visible section also includes the Zoo Labs logo and links to the website's home page and donation page, while the hidden section includes links to the website's privacy policy and terms of service.",
