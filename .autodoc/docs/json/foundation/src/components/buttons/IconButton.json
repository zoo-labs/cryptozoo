  "summary": "The `IconButton` component is a reusable button component that can be used throughout the project. It is built using React and the `react-icons` library. The component accepts several props, including `isLoading`, `isDarkBg`, `variant`, `icon`, and `iconClassName`. \n\nThe `variant` prop determines the appearance of the button and can be one of five values: `primary`, `outline`, `ghost`, `light`, or `dark`. The `isDarkBg` prop is a boolean that determines whether the button is on a dark background. The `icon` prop is an icon from the `react-icons` library that will be displayed on the button. The `iconClassName` prop is an optional class name that can be applied to the icon.\n\nThe `IconButton` component renders a `button` element with the appropriate classes based on the props passed to it. The `clsxm` function is used to conditionally apply classes based on the `variant` and `isDarkBg` props. The `isLoading` prop is used to disable the button and display a spinner while the button is loading. \n\nIf the `isLoading` prop is `true`, the button is disabled and a spinner is displayed in the center of the button. The spinner is an instance of the `ImSpinner2` icon from the `react-icons/im` library. The color of the spinner is determined by the `variant` prop.\n\nIf the `icon` prop is provided, the icon is displayed to the left of the button text. The `iconClassName` prop can be used to apply additional classes to the icon.\n\nOverall, the `IconButton` component provides a flexible and reusable button component that can be customized to fit the needs of the project. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as forms, modals, and navigation menus. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport IconButton from './path/to/IconButton';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <IconButton variant=\"primary\" icon={SomeIcon} onClick={handleClick}>\n        Click me\n      </IconButton>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",
