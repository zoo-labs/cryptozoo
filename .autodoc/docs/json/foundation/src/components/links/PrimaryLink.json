  "summary": "The code defines a React component called `PrimaryLink` that renders an anchor element (`<a>`) styled as a button. The component accepts several props, including `className`, `children`, and `variant`. The `variant` prop determines the color scheme of the button and can be either `'primary'` or `'basic'`. \n\nThe `PrimaryLink` component is built on top of another component called `UnstyledLink`, which is imported from `@/components/links/UnstyledLink`. `UnstyledLink` is a custom component that renders an anchor element without any default styling. The `PrimaryLink` component applies custom styles to the `UnstyledLink` component to create a button-like appearance.\n\nThe `PrimaryLink` component uses the `clsxm` library to conditionally apply CSS classes to the `UnstyledLink` component based on the `variant` prop. If `variant` is `'primary'`, the button will have a blue color scheme (`text-primary-500`), and if `variant` is `'basic'`, the button will have a black color scheme (`text-black`). The button also has hover and active states that change the text color to a darker shade of the primary or black color. If the button is disabled, the text color will be a lighter shade of the primary or black color.\n\nThe `PrimaryLink` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, if a developer wants to render a blue button that links to a page, they can import the `PrimaryLink` component and use it like this:\n\n```\nimport PrimaryLink from '@/components/links/PrimaryLink';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <PrimaryLink href=\"/my-page\" variant=\"primary\">\n      Click me!\n    </PrimaryLink>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nThis will render a blue button that links to the `/my-page` URL. The button will have the text \"Click me!\" inside it.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `PrimaryLink` component?\n   \n   The `PrimaryLink` component is a custom link component that accepts a `variant` prop and renders a styled link based on the value of the `variant` prop.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `UnstyledLink` component and where is it imported from?\n   \n   The `UnstyledLink` component is a custom link component that renders an anchor element without any default styling. It is imported from the `@/components/links/UnstyledLink` module.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `clsxm` function and where is it imported from?\n   \n   The `clsxm` function is a utility function that combines multiple class names into a single string. It is imported from the `@/lib/clsxm` module.",
