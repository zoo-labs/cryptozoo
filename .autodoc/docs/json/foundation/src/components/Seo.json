  "summary": "The code is a React component that generates meta tags for search engine optimization (SEO) and social media sharing. The component is called Seo and takes in props that can override the default meta tags. The default meta tags are defined in the constant defaultMeta. \n\nThe component uses the Head component from the Next.js library to add the meta tags to the HTML head section. The useRouter hook is used to get the current URL path. \n\nThe meta tags include the title, description, URL, and image for the website. The Open Graph protocol is used to provide additional metadata for social media sharing. Twitter-specific meta tags are also included. \n\nThe component also includes links to various favicon images and a manifest file for progressive web apps. \n\nThe Seo component can be used in any page of the Zoo project to provide consistent and customizable meta tags. For example, a page about a specific animal in the zoo can use the Seo component to set the title to the animal's name and the image to a photo of the animal. \n\nHere is an example of how the Seo component can be used:\n\n```\nimport Seo from '../components/Seo';\n\nfunction AnimalPage({ animal }) {\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Seo\n        templateTitle={animal.name}\n        description={animal.description}\n        image={animal.image}\n      />\n      <h1>{animal.name}</h1>\n      <p>{animal.description}</p>\n      <img src={animal.image} alt={animal.name} />\n    </>\n  );\n}\n```",
