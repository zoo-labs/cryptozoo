  "summary": "The code above defines a React component called Principles that renders a section of the Zoo website. The purpose of this component is to display the principles that drive the Zoo's mission and encourage visitors to donate, get involved, or learn more about the organization.\n\nThe component is composed of a div element with a black background and a height of 52 pixels on larger screens and 28 pixels on smaller screens. Inside this div, there is another div element with a white background that contains the content of the section. The content is centered horizontally and vertically and has a maximum width of 16 pixels on smaller screens.\n\nThe content of the section consists of a title, five paragraphs, and three links. The title is centered and has a white color. It is displayed in a larger font size on larger screens and a smaller font size on smaller screens. The title has an underline that is achieved by wrapping the \"us\" word in an HTML u tag.\n\nThe five paragraphs describe the principles that drive the Zoo's mission. Each paragraph has a white color and a font size that varies depending on the screen size. The first paragraph is bold and describes the Zoo's commitment to wildlife conservation. The second paragraph describes the Zoo's goal of inspiring positive action through education. The third paragraph highlights the Zoo's use of innovative technology. The fourth paragraph emphasizes the importance of engaging communities for species protection. The fifth and final paragraph describes the Zoo's mission to foster human-nature coexistence.\n\nThe three links at the bottom of the section encourage visitors to donate, get involved, or learn more about the Zoo. Each link is wrapped in a Next.js Link component that provides client-side navigation without a full page refresh. The links have different styles depending on their background color, text color, and border color. The first link is white with a black border and black text on hover. The second link is black with a white border and white text on hover. The third link is black with a white border and white text on hover, but it is only displayed on smaller screens.\n\nOverall, the Principles component is an important part of the Zoo website that communicates the organization's mission and encourages visitors to take action. It is a well-designed and responsive section that adapts to different screen sizes and provides an easy way to navigate to other parts of the website.",
