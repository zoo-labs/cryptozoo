  "summary": "The `Donation` function in this code file is responsible for rendering a donation page for the zoo project. The page displays three donation options with different amounts and descriptions of how the funds will be used. The first two options are fixed amounts of $50 and $100, respectively, while the third option allows the user to enter a custom donation amount. \n\nThe function uses an array of objects called `comments` to store the donation options. Each object has three properties: `title`, `comment`, and `type`. The `title` property stores the donation amount, the `comment` property provides a description of how the funds will be used, and the `type` property specifies whether the donation is a fixed amount or a custom amount. \n\nThe function then maps over the `comments` array to render each donation option as a separate `div` element. Each `div` contains the `title` and `comment` properties of the corresponding object from the `comments` array. If the `type` property of the object is `'normal'`, the `div` also contains a `Link` component that allows the user to navigate to a donation page. If the `type` property is `'custom'`, the `div` contains an input field that allows the user to enter a custom donation amount. \n\nThe function uses various CSS classes to style the donation page, including `text-gray-300`, `text-white`, `text-center`, `max-md`, `xl`, `md`, `lg`, `py-16`, `pb-10`, `w-full`, `border`, `rounded-xl`, and `cursor-pointer`. \n\nOverall, this code file provides a simple and user-friendly way for zoo visitors to make donations to support the zoo's conservation efforts. The `Donation` function can be imported and used in other parts of the zoo project to create a donation page or component. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport Donation from './Donation';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Donation />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```",

What is the structure of the `comments` array and how is it used in the code?\n- The `comments` array is an array of objects that contain information about different donation options, including the title, comment, and type. It is used to dynamically render each donation option on the page.\n\n3. What is the difference between the `normal` and `custom` types of donation options?\n- The `normal` type of donation option has a fixed donation amount and includes a \"Donate\" button that redirects the user to a donation page. The `custom` type of donation option allows the user to enter a custom donation amount and includes an input field for the user to enter their desired amount.",
