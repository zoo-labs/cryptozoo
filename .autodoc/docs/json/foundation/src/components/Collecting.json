  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `Collecting`. This component renders a section of the web page related to collecting digital collectibles. The section has a black background and contains a heading, an image, and two links. \n\nThe heading is centered and has white text. It reads \"Start Collecting\" and is displayed in a larger font size on larger screens. \n\nThe image is displayed below the heading and is centered. It is a digital image of a collectible card and is loaded from the `/images/collecting.png` file. The image is displayed at a width of 3/5 of its container and has a fixed height of 800 pixels. \n\nBelow the image, there are two links displayed side by side on larger screens and stacked vertically on smaller screens. The links are styled as text with an arrow icon to the right. The first link has the text \"View Endangered Cards\" and is not currently linked to any URL. The second link has the text \"Shop Digital Collectibles\" and is linked to the `/collect` URL. \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project to display a section of the web page related to collecting digital collectibles. It can be imported and rendered within another component or page using the following code:\n\n```\nimport Collecting from 'path/to/Collecting';\n\nfunction MyPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Collecting />\n      {/* other page content */}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n``` \n\nThis will render the `Collecting` component within the `MyPage` component, allowing the user to view and interact with the collectibles section of the page.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Link` and `Image` imports?\n- The `Link` import is used to create clickable links to other pages, while the `Image` import is used to display an image on the page.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `max-md` class in the code?\n- The `max-md` class is used to apply styles only to screens with a maximum width of the medium breakpoint, which is typically around 768px.\n\n3. Why are there SVG paths in the `Link` components?\n- The SVG paths are used to display an arrow icon next to the link text, indicating that the link will take the user to another page.",
