  "summary": "The code above defines three constants that are used to determine the environment in which the code is running. The first constant, `isProd`, checks if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `'production'`. If it is, then `isProd` is set to `true`. Otherwise, it is set to `false`. This constant can be used to determine if the code is running in a production environment or not.\n\nThe second constant, `isLocal`, checks if the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is set to `'development'`. If it is, then `isLocal` is set to `true`. Otherwise, it is set to `false`. This constant can be used to determine if the code is running in a local development environment or not.\n\nThe third constant, `showLogger`, is a bit more complex. It first checks if `isLocal` is `true`. If it is, then `showLogger` is set to `true`. This means that the logger will be shown in the console when running the code locally. If `isLocal` is `false`, then `showLogger` checks if the `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_LOGGER` environment variable is set to `'true'`. If it is, then `showLogger` is set to `true`. Otherwise, it is set to `false`. This constant can be used to determine if the logger should be shown or not.\n\nOverall, this code is used to determine the environment in which the code is running and whether or not the logger should be shown. This information can be used to configure the code differently depending on the environment. For example, if the code is running in a production environment, certain features may be disabled or optimized for performance. If the code is running locally, the logger may be shown to aid in debugging. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```javascript\nif (isProd) {\n  // disable certain features for production environment\n}\n\nif (isLocal) {\n  // enable additional debugging features for local development\n}\n\nif (showLogger) {\n  console.log('Logger enabled');\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code exports three constants related to the environment: `isProd` checks if the environment is production, `isLocal` checks if the environment is development, and `showLogger` determines whether to show a logger based on the environment and a public variable.\n\n2. What is the significance of `process.env.NODE_ENV` and `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_LOGGER`?\n   `process.env.NODE_ENV` is a built-in Node.js variable that indicates the current environment (e.g. development, production). `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_LOGGER` is a public variable that can be set to `true` or `false` to control whether to show a logger.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `??` operator in the `showLogger` constant?\n   The `??` operator is a nullish coalescing operator that returns the left-hand side if it is not `null` or `undefined`, otherwise it returns the right-hand side. In this case, it returns `false` if `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_LOGGER` is `null` or `undefined`.",
