  "summary": "The code defines a class called `TopologicalSort` which implements a topological sorting algorithm. Topological sorting is a way of ordering a directed graph's vertices such that for every directed edge from vertex A to vertex B, vertex A comes before vertex B in the ordering. This is useful in many applications, such as scheduling tasks that depend on each other.\n\nThe `TopologicalSort` class takes two generic type parameters: `KeyType` and `ValueType`. `KeyType` is the type of the keys used to identify nodes in the graph, while `ValueType` is the type of the values associated with each node. The class has several methods:\n\n- `constructor(nodes: Map<KeyType, ValueType>)`: constructs a new `TopologicalSort` instance with the given nodes. The nodes are passed in as a `Map` where the keys are the node keys and the values are the node values.\n- `addNode(key: KeyType, node: ValueType)`: adds a new node to the graph with the given key and value.\n- `addNodes(nodes: Map<KeyType, ValueType>)`: adds multiple nodes to the graph.\n- `addEdge(fromKey: KeyType, toKey: KeyType)`: adds a directed edge from the node with key `fromKey` to the node with key `toKey`.\n- `sort(): Map<KeyType, INodeWithChildren<KeyType, ValueType>>`: performs a topological sort on the graph and returns a `Map` where the keys are the node keys and the values are objects containing the node value and a `Map` of child nodes.\n\nThe `TopologicalSort` class uses two interfaces: `INodeWithChildren` and `InternalNodesMap`. `INodeWithChildren` is an interface for objects containing a node value and a `Map` of child nodes. `InternalNodesMap` is a type alias for a `Map` where the keys are node keys and the values are objects of type `INodeWithChildren`.\n\nThe `TopologicalSort` class maintains three private properties:\n\n- `nodes`: a `Map` where the keys are node keys and the values are objects of type `INodeWithChildren`.\n- `visitedNodes`: a `Set` of nodes that have already been visited during the topological sort.\n- `sortedKeysStack`: an array of node keys representing the sorted order of the nodes.\n\nThe `TopologicalSort` class has two private methods:\n\n- `exploreNode(nodeKey: KeyType, explorePath: KeyType[])`: recursively explores the node with the given key and adds its children to the sorted order.\n- `addInternalNode(key: KeyType, node: ValueType)`: adds a new internal node to the `nodes` map.\n\nOverall, the `TopologicalSort` class provides a way to perform topological sorting on a directed graph. It can be used in a larger project to order tasks or dependencies in a way that satisfies their dependencies. Here's an example of how to use the `TopologicalSort` class:\n\n```typescript\nconst graph = new Map<string, string>([\n  ['a', 'A'],\n  ['b', 'B'],\n  ['c', 'C'],\n  ['d', 'D'],\n  ['e', 'E'],\n  ['f', 'F'],\n]);\n\nconst sorter = new TopologicalSort(graph);\nsorter.addEdge('a', 'b');\nsorter.addEdge('a', 'c');\nsorter.addEdge('b', 'd');\nsorter.addEdge('c', 'd');\nsorter.addEdge('d', 'e');\nsorter.addEdge('f', 'e');\n\nconst sortedNodes = sorter.sort();\nconsole.log(sortedNodes);\n```\n\nThis will output:\n\n```\nMap {\n  'a' => { children: Map { 'b' => [Object], 'c' => [Object] }, node: 'A' },\n  'f' => { children: Map { 'e' => [Object] }, node: 'F' },\n  'b' => { children: Map { 'd' => [Object] }, node: 'B' },\n  'c' => { children: Map { 'd' => [Object] }, node: 'C' },\n  'd' => { children: Map { 'e' => [Object] }, node: 'D' },\n  'e' => { children: Map {}, node: 'E' }\n}\n```\n\nThis shows the sorted order of the nodes in the graph. Node `a` comes first, followed by `f`, then `b` and `c`, then `d`, and finally `e`.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code is a TypeScript implementation of a topological sort algorithm, which is used to sort a directed acyclic graph (DAG) in a specific order.\n\n2. What are the input and output of the `sort` method?\n- The `sort` method takes no arguments and returns a `Map` object that maps each key in the input DAG to an `INodeWithChildren` object that contains the node value and its children.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `visitedNodes` and `sortedKeysStack` properties?\n- The `visitedNodes` property is a `Set` that keeps track of the nodes that have already been visited during the graph traversal, while the `sortedKeysStack` property is an array that stores the keys of the nodes in the order they were visited. These properties are used to ensure that each node is visited only once and to generate the final sorted order of the nodes.",
