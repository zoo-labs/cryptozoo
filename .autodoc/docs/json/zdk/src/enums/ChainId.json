  "summary": "The code above defines an enum called `ChainId` which contains a list of blockchain network IDs. Each ID is assigned a name that corresponds to the name of the network. This enum is likely used in the larger project to identify which blockchain network the project is currently interacting with.\n\nFor example, if the project is interacting with the Ethereum mainnet, the `ChainId.MAINNET` value can be used to identify the network. Similarly, if the project is interacting with the Binance Smart Chain testnet, the `ChainId.BSC_TESTNET` value can be used.\n\nThis enum can be imported and used in other parts of the project to ensure that the correct network is being interacted with. For example, if the project has a function that sends a transaction to a smart contract, the function can check the current network ID against the `ChainId` enum to ensure that the transaction is being sent to the correct network.\n\nHere is an example of how the `ChainId` enum can be used in a TypeScript file:\n\n```\nimport { ChainId } from 'zoo';\n\nconst currentNetworkId = 1; // assume we are on the Ethereum mainnet\n\nif (currentNetworkId === ChainId.MAINNET) {\n  // send transaction to smart contract on Ethereum mainnet\n} else if (currentNetworkId === ChainId.BSC) {\n  // send transaction to smart contract on Binance Smart Chain\n} else {\n  // handle unsupported network\n}\n```\n\nOverall, the `ChainId` enum is a useful tool for ensuring that the project is interacting with the correct blockchain network.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n    \n    This code defines an enum called `ChainId` which contains a list of chain IDs for various blockchain networks.\n\n2. What is an enum and why is it used here?\n    \n    An enum is a type in TypeScript that allows developers to define a set of named constants. In this code, the `ChainId` enum is used to define a set of constants that represent the chain IDs for various blockchain networks.\n\n3. What are some examples of blockchain networks represented by the constants in this enum?\n    \n    Some examples of blockchain networks represented by the constants in this enum include Ethereum mainnet (1), Binance Smart Chain (56), Avalanche (43114), and Celo (42220).",
