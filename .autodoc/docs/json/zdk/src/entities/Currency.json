  "summary": "The code above defines a type called `Currency` which can be either a `NativeCurrency` or a `Token`. This is part of a larger project called `zoo` which likely deals with financial transactions involving different types of currencies.\n\nThe `NativeCurrency` class likely represents a native currency of the platform or blockchain being used, while the `Token` class represents a custom token created on top of the platform. By defining a type that can be either of these, the code allows for flexibility in handling different types of currencies within the project.\n\nThis `Currency` type can be used throughout the project to ensure that any function or method that deals with currencies can accept either a `NativeCurrency` or a `Token`. For example, a function that calculates the exchange rate between two currencies could accept two `Currency` objects as arguments, regardless of whether they are native or custom tokens.\n\nHere is an example of how this `Currency` type could be used in a function:\n\n```\nfunction convertCurrency(amount: number, from: Currency, to: Currency): number {\n  // code to convert amount from one currency to another\n}\n\nconst eth = new NativeCurrency('ETH');\nconst dai = new Token('DAI', '0x123abc');\n\nconst convertedAmount = convertCurrency(10, eth, dai);\n```\n\nIn the example above, the `convertCurrency` function accepts three arguments: the amount to convert, the currency to convert from, and the currency to convert to. The `from` and `to` arguments are both of type `Currency`, which means they can be either a `NativeCurrency` or a `Token`. The function then performs the necessary calculations to convert the amount from one currency to another.\n\nOverall, this code provides a flexible and extensible way to handle different types of currencies within the `zoo` project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Currency` type and how is it used in the `zoo` project?\n   - The `Currency` type is used to represent either a native currency or a token in the `zoo` project. It is imported from two other files, `NativeCurrency` and `Token`, which likely define the specific properties and behaviors of each type.\n\n2. Are there any other types or interfaces related to `Currency` that are defined elsewhere in the `zoo` project?\n   - It is unclear from this code snippet whether there are any other related types or interfaces defined elsewhere in the `zoo` project. Further investigation of the project's codebase would be necessary to determine this.\n\n3. How might a developer add a new type of currency to the `Currency` type?\n   - It is not immediately clear from this code snippet how a developer might add a new type of currency to the `Currency` type. Depending on the implementation of `NativeCurrency` and `Token`, it may be necessary to modify those files as well. Further investigation of the project's codebase and documentation would be necessary to determine the proper procedure for adding a new currency type.",
