  "summary": "The code in this file provides a function for computing the square root of a given value, rounded down to the nearest integer. The function takes a single argument, `value`, which is expected to be a JSBI (JavaScript BigInt) object. \n\nThe function first checks that the input value is not negative, using the `invariant` function from the `tiny-invariant` library. If the input value is negative, the function throws an error with the message 'NEGATIVE'. \n\nNext, the function checks if the input value is less than the maximum safe integer value that can be represented in JavaScript. If it is, the function uses the built-in `Math.sqrt` function to compute the square root of the input value, converts the result to a BigInt using `JSBI.BigInt`, and returns it. If the input value is greater than or equal to the maximum safe integer value, the function uses a custom algorithm to compute the square root. \n\nThe custom algorithm used by the function is an implementation of the Babylonian method for computing square roots. The algorithm starts by initializing two BigInt variables, `z` and `x`, to the input value and the value `(value / 2) + 1`, respectively. It then enters a loop that continues until `x` is no longer less than `z`. In each iteration of the loop, the value of `z` is updated to the current value of `x`, and the value of `x` is updated to `(value / x + x) / 2`. Once the loop terminates, the final value of `z` is returned as the square root of the input value, rounded down to the nearest integer. \n\nThis function could be used in a variety of contexts within the larger project. For example, it could be used to compute the square root of a user-provided input value in a financial application that requires high precision arithmetic. It could also be used as a helper function in other mathematical calculations that require square roots. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { sqrt } from 'zoo'\n\nconst input = JSBI.BigInt('12345678901234567890')\nconst result = sqrt(input)\nconsole.log(result.toString()) // '351364182'\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `JSBI` library and why is it being used in this code?\n- `JSBI` is a library for working with large integers in JavaScript. It is being used in this code to perform mathematical operations on large integers.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` constant and how is it being used in the code?\n- `MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` is a constant that represents the maximum safe integer value in JavaScript. It is being used in the code to determine whether the built-in `Math.sqrt` function can be used to compute the square root of the input value.\n\n3. What is the algorithm being used to compute the square root of the input value and why is it being used instead of the built-in `Math.sqrt` function?\n- The code is using the Babylonian method to compute the square root of the input value. This algorithm is being used instead of the built-in `Math.sqrt` function for values that exceed the maximum safe integer value in JavaScript.",
