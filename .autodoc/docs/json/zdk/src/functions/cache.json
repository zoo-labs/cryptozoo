  "summary": "The code above defines a function called `cachedFetch` that allows for caching of HTTP requests using the `memory-cache` library. The function takes in three parameters: `url`, `options`, and `ttl`. `url` is the URL of the resource to be fetched, `options` is an optional object that can contain additional parameters for the fetch request (such as headers or request method), and `ttl` is the time-to-live for the cached response in milliseconds (default is 60000ms or 1 minute).\n\nThe function first checks if there is a cached response for the given `url` using the `cache.get` method from the `memory-cache` library. If there is a cached response, it returns the cached response. If there is no cached response, it makes a fetch request to the `url` using the `fetch` API and `options` object. It then waits for the response to be returned as JSON using the `response.json()` method. Once the data is received, it is stored in the cache using the `cache.put` method from the `memory-cache` library with the `url`, `data`, and `ttl` parameters. Finally, the function returns the fetched data.\n\nThis function can be used in a larger project to reduce the number of HTTP requests made to the server by caching responses for a certain amount of time. For example, if a website has a frequently accessed API endpoint that returns data that does not change often, this function can be used to cache the response for a certain amount of time to reduce the number of requests made to the server. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nconst data = await cachedFetch('https://example.com/api/data', { method: 'POST', headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' } }, 300000);\n// This will fetch the data from the API endpoint and cache the response for 5 minutes (300000ms)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `cachedFetch` function?\n   - The `cachedFetch` function is used to fetch data from a given URL and cache the response for a specified time period using the `memory-cache` library.\n\n2. What is the default value for the `ttl` parameter?\n   - The default value for the `ttl` parameter is 60000 milliseconds (1 minute).\n\n3. What happens if the response from the URL is not in the cache?\n   - If the response from the URL is not in the cache, the function will fetch the data from the URL using the `fetch` API, cache the response using `memory-cache`, and return the data.",
