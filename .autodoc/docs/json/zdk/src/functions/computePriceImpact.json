  "summary": "The code in this file contains a function called `computePriceImpact` that calculates the percent difference between the mid price and the execution price of a trade. This is also known as the price impact. \n\nThe function takes in three parameters: `midPrice`, `inputAmount`, and `outputAmount`. `midPrice` is the mid price before the trade, while `inputAmount` and `outputAmount` are the input and output amounts of the trade, respectively. \n\nThe function first calculates the quoted output amount by calling the `quote` method on `midPrice` with `inputAmount` as the argument. This gives the expected output amount based on the mid price. \n\nNext, the function calculates the price impact by subtracting `outputAmount` from `quotedOutputAmount` and dividing the result by `quotedOutputAmount`. The resulting value is then used to create a new `Percent` object, which is returned by the function. \n\nThis function is likely used in a larger project that involves trading currencies. It can be used to determine the price impact of a trade, which can be useful in making decisions about whether to execute the trade or not. \n\nHere is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```\nimport { computePriceImpact } from 'zoo'\n\nconst midPrice = new Price(new Currency('USD'), new Currency('EUR'), '1.2')\nconst inputAmount = new CurrencyAmount(new Currency('USD'), '100')\nconst outputAmount = new CurrencyAmount(new Currency('EUR'), '110')\n\nconst priceImpact = computePriceImpact(midPrice, inputAmount, outputAmount)\n\nconsole.log(priceImpact.toString()) // Output: \"8.333333333333334\"\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `midPrice` object with a USD/EUR exchange rate of 1.2. We then create `inputAmount` and `outputAmount` objects representing a trade of 100 USD for 110 EUR. We pass these objects to `computePriceImpact` along with `midPrice` and store the result in `priceImpact`. Finally, we log the value of `priceImpact` to the console, which should be approximately 8.33%.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `computePriceImpact` function?\n- The function calculates the percent difference between the mid price and the execution price, also known as price impact.\n\n2. What are the input parameters of the `computePriceImpact` function?\n- The function takes in three parameters: `midPrice` which is the mid price before the trade, `inputAmount` which is the input amount of the trade, and `outputAmount` which is the output amount of the trade.\n\n3. What is the output of the `computePriceImpact` function?\n- The function returns a `Percent` object which represents the calculated price impact.",
