  "summary": "This code defines a type called `TokenMap` which is an object that maps a `chainId` number to a `Token` object. The `Token` object is imported from a file located in the `entities` directory. \n\nThis type can be used in the larger project to keep track of different tokens on different chains. For example, if the project involves a decentralized exchange that supports multiple blockchains, the `TokenMap` can be used to store information about the tokens available on each chain. \n\nHere is an example of how this type can be used:\n\n```\nimport { TokenMap } from 'zoo'\n\nconst tokens: TokenMap = {\n  1: {\n    name: 'Ethereum',\n    symbol: 'ETH',\n    address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n  },\n  56: {\n    name: 'Binance Coin',\n    symbol: 'BNB',\n    address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'\n  }\n}\n\nconsole.log(tokens[1].name) // Output: Ethereum\nconsole.log(tokens[56].symbol) // Output: BNB\n```\n\nIn this example, we create a `TokenMap` object called `tokens` that maps the `chainId` of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain to their respective `Token` objects. We can then access the properties of each `Token` object by using the `chainId` as the key. \n\nOverall, this code provides a useful data structure for storing information about tokens on different blockchains in a decentralized application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Token` import from the `../entities` file?\n   - The `Token` import is likely used within the `TokenMap` type to define the structure of the object.\n2. What is the `TokenMap` type used for in the `zoo` project?\n   - The `TokenMap` type is likely used to store a mapping of `Token` objects to their corresponding `chainId` values.\n3. Are there any other files or modules that use the `TokenMap` type?\n   - Without further context, it is unclear if any other files or modules use the `TokenMap` type.",
