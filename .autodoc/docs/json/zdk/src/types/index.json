  "summary": "This code exports various types and interfaces from different files within the zoo project. \n\nThe `BigIntIsh` file exports a type definition for a `BigIntIsh` type, which is used to represent a large integer value. This type is used throughout the project to handle large numbers, such as token amounts and exchange rates.\n\nThe `MultiRouterTypes` file exports several interfaces and types related to the MultiRouter feature of the zoo project. These include `Route`, `Trade`, and `SwapParameters`, which are used to define and execute trades between different tokens on various decentralized exchanges.\n\nThe `LimitOrderTypes` file exports types related to limit orders, which allow users to set a specific price at which they are willing to buy or sell a token. These types include `LimitOrder`, `LimitOrderFields`, and `LimitOrderResponse`, which are used to define and execute limit orders on supported exchanges.\n\nFinally, the `AddressMap` file exports an interface for an `AddressMap` type, which is used to map different contract addresses to their corresponding names within the zoo project. This is useful for keeping track of different contracts and their functions within the project.\n\nOverall, this code is essential for defining and using various types and interfaces throughout the zoo project. By exporting these definitions, other files within the project can easily import and use them as needed. For example, a file that handles limit orders may import the `LimitOrderTypes` file to access the necessary type definitions. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```typescript\nimport { Route, Trade } from './MultiRouterTypes';\n\nconst route: Route = {\n  path: ['ETH', 'USDC', 'DAI'],\n  input: '1000000000000000000',\n  output: '0',\n  trades: [\n    {\n      inputAmount: '1000000000000000000',\n      outputAmount: '500000000000000000',\n      inputToken: 'ETH',\n      outputToken: 'USDC',\n      exchange: 'Uniswap',\n      tradeToRouteInputAmount: true,\n    },\n    {\n      inputAmount: '500000000000000000',\n      outputAmount: '1000000000000000000',\n      inputToken: 'USDC',\n      outputToken: 'DAI',\n      exchange: 'Uniswap',\n      tradeToRouteInputAmount: false,\n    },\n  ],\n};\n\nconst trade: Trade = {\n  inputAmount: '1000000000000000000',\n  outputAmount: '500000000000000000',\n  inputToken: 'ETH',\n  outputToken: 'USDC',\n  exchange: 'Uniswap',\n};\n``` \n\nIn this example, we import the `Route` and `Trade` types from the `MultiRouterTypes` file and use them to define a route and a trade. These types provide a clear and consistent way to define and execute trades on various decentralized exchanges.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this file in the `zoo` project?**\\\n   This file exports various types and interfaces from different modules within the `zoo` project, likely for use in other parts of the project.\n\n2. **What are the contents of the `BigIntIsh`, `MultiRouterTypes`, `LimitOrderTypes`, and `AddressMap` modules?**\\\n   To fully understand the functionality of this file, a developer may want to investigate the contents of each of the modules being exported.\n\n3. **Are there any potential naming conflicts or compatibility issues with the exported types and interfaces?**\\\n   Depending on how the exported types and interfaces are used in other parts of the project, there may be naming conflicts or compatibility issues that need to be addressed.",
