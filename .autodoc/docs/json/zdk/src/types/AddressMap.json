  "summary": "The code above defines a type called `AddressMap` which is an object that maps a `chainId` number to a corresponding string address. This type can be used throughout the larger project to store and retrieve addresses for different chains. \n\nFor example, if the project has functionality that interacts with multiple blockchain networks, it may need to store the addresses of contracts or other important entities on each network. The `AddressMap` type can be used to create an object that stores these addresses in a way that is easy to access and update. \n\nHere is an example of how the `AddressMap` type could be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport { AddressMap } from 'zoo';\n\nconst contractAddresses: AddressMap = {\n  1: '0x123abc...',\n  3: '0x456def...',\n  4: '0x789ghi...'\n};\n\n// Access the address for chainId 1\nconst addressForChain1 = contractAddresses[1];\n```\n\nIn this example, an `AddressMap` object is created to store the addresses of a contract on three different chains. The `const` keyword is used to define the variable `contractAddresses` as an `AddressMap` type. The object is then populated with the addresses for each chain. \n\nTo access a specific address, the `[]` notation is used with the corresponding `chainId` number. In this case, `addressForChain1` would be set to `'0x123abc...'`. \n\nOverall, the `AddressMap` type provides a convenient way to store and access addresses for different chains in a larger project.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?** \nA smart developer might wonder what this code is used for and how it fits into the overall functionality of the zoo project. Based on the code alone, it appears to be defining a type called `AddressMap` that maps chain IDs to string addresses.\n\n2. **What is the expected input and output of this code?** \nA smart developer might want to know what the expected input and output of this code is, and how it is used within the project. Based on the code alone, it appears that the input is a number representing a chain ID, and the output is a string representing the address associated with that chain ID.\n\n3. **Are there any potential issues or limitations with this code?** \nA smart developer might want to know if there are any potential issues or limitations with this code, such as edge cases that may not be handled properly or performance concerns. Based on the code alone, it is difficult to determine any potential issues or limitations without more context about how this code is used within the project.",
