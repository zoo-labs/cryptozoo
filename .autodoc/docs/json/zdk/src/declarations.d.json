  "summary": "This code is a module declaration for a package called 'toformat'. The purpose of this module is to provide a set of functions that can be used to format data in various ways. The module is designed to be used in conjunction with other modules in a larger project, such as a web application or data processing pipeline.\n\nThe 'toformat' module provides a number of functions that can be used to format data in different ways. For example, there is a function called 'toCurrency' that can be used to format a number as a currency value. This function takes a number as input and returns a string that represents the number in currency format. Here is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```\nconst toformat = require('toformat');\n\nconst price = 1234.56;\nconst formattedPrice = toformat.toCurrency(price);\n\nconsole.log(formattedPrice); // \"$1,234.56\"\n```\n\nIn addition to the 'toCurrency' function, there are other functions provided by the 'toformat' module that can be used to format data in different ways. For example, there is a function called 'toPercentage' that can be used to format a number as a percentage value. This function takes a number as input and returns a string that represents the number as a percentage. Here is an example of how this function can be used:\n\n```\nconst toformat = require('toformat');\n\nconst percentage = 0.75;\nconst formattedPercentage = toformat.toPercentage(percentage);\n\nconsole.log(formattedPercentage); // \"75%\"\n```\n\nOverall, the 'toformat' module provides a set of useful functions that can be used to format data in various ways. These functions can be used in a larger project to ensure that data is presented in a consistent and readable format.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the 'toformat' module?\n   - The code is simply declaring the 'toformat' module, so it is unclear what its purpose is without further context or documentation.\n\n2. Is the 'toformat' module being used elsewhere in the project?\n   - It is not clear from this code snippet whether or not the 'toformat' module is being imported or used elsewhere in the 'zoo' project.\n\n3. Are there any dependencies required for the 'toformat' module to work properly?\n   - Without additional information, it is unclear whether or not the 'toformat' module has any dependencies that need to be installed or configured in order for it to function properly.",
