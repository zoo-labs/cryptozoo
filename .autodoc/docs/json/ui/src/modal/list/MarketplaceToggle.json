  "summary": "The code above is a React component that renders a toggle switch for a marketplace. The component takes in two props: `marketplace` and `onSelection`. The `marketplace` prop is an object that contains information about the marketplace, such as its name, image URL, and fee percentage. The `onSelection` prop is a callback function that is called when the toggle switch is clicked.\n\nThe component is composed of several sub-components from the `primitives` module, including `Box`, `Text`, `Flex`, and `Switch`. The `Box` component is used to wrap the marketplace image, while the `Text` component is used to display the marketplace name and fee percentage. The `Flex` component is used to align these sub-components horizontally, and the `Switch` component is used to render the toggle switch.\n\nThe `MarketplaceToggle` component is designed to be used in a larger project that involves multiple marketplaces. It can be used to display a list of marketplaces and allow the user to select one or more of them. When the user selects a marketplace, the `onSelection` callback function is called, which can be used to update the state of the parent component.\n\nHere is an example of how the `MarketplaceToggle` component can be used:\n\n```\nimport React, { useState } from 'react'\nimport MarketplaceToggle from './MarketplaceToggle'\nimport { marketplaces } from './marketplaces'\n\nconst MarketplaceList = () => {\n  const [selectedMarketplaces, setSelectedMarketplaces] = useState([])\n\n  const handleSelection = (marketplace) => {\n    if (selectedMarketplaces.includes(marketplace)) {\n      setSelectedMarketplaces(selectedMarketplaces.filter((m) => m !== marketplace))\n    } else {\n      setSelectedMarketplaces([...selectedMarketplaces, marketplace])\n    }\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {marketplaces.map((marketplace) => (\n        <MarketplaceToggle\n          key={marketplace.id}\n          marketplace={marketplace}\n          onSelection={() => handleSelection(marketplace)}\n        />\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default MarketplaceList\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MarketplaceList` component renders a list of marketplaces using the `MarketplaceToggle` component. The `marketplaces` array contains information about each marketplace, including its name, image URL, and fee percentage. The `selectedMarketplaces` state variable is an array that keeps track of which marketplaces are currently selected.\n\nThe `handleSelection` function is called when the user clicks on a toggle switch. If the selected marketplace is already in the `selectedMarketplaces` array, it is removed. Otherwise, it is added to the array.\n\nOverall, the `MarketplaceToggle` component is a reusable component that can be used to render a toggle switch for a marketplace in a larger project. It is flexible and can be customized to fit the specific needs of the project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a React component called `MarketplaceToggle` that renders a toggle switch for a marketplace with its name, image, and fee percentage.\n\n2. What are the props expected by the `MarketplaceToggle` component?\n   The `MarketplaceToggle` component expects two props: `marketplace`, which is an object containing information about the marketplace being toggled, and `onSelection`, which is a function that gets called when the toggle switch is clicked.\n\n3. What are the dependencies of this code?\n   This code depends on the `React` library and several components from a custom `primitives` library, as well as a custom `useMarketplaces` hook that provides information about marketplaces.",
