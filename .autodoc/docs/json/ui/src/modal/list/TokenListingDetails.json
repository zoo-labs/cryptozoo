  "summary": "The `TokenListingDetails` component is a React functional component that renders a token and its associated listing data. It takes in several props, including a `token` object, a `collection` object, an array of `listingData`, and a `currency` object. \n\nThe `Token` component is imported from a file called `Token` and is used to render the token. The `ListingStat` component is imported from a file called `ListingStat` and is used to render the listing data. \n\nThe component is wrapped in a `Flex` component from a file called `Flex` and a `Box` component from a file called `Box`. These components are used to create a flexible layout that adjusts based on the screen size. \n\nThe `TokenListingDetails` component maps over the `listingData` array and renders a `ListingStat` component for each item in the array. The `ListingStat` component takes in several props, including a `listing` object, a `marketImg` string, and a `currency` object. \n\nThe `TokenListingDetails` component is exported as the default export of the file. This allows other files to import and use the component in their own React components. \n\nThis component is likely used in a larger project that involves displaying tokens and their associated listing data. It could be used in a marketplace application where users can buy and sell tokens. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport TokenListingDetails from './TokenListingDetails'\n\nfunction App() {\n  const token = { /* token object */ }\n  const collection = { /* collection object */ }\n  const listingData = [ /* array of listing data objects */ ]\n  const currency = { /* currency object */ }\n\n  return (\n    <TokenListingDetails\n      token={token}\n      collection={collection}\n      listingData={listingData}\n      currency={currency}\n    />\n  )\n}\n```",
