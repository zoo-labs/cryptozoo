  "summary": "The `Progress` component in the `zoo` project is a React functional component that renders a progress indicator with a title, an icon, and a link to a block explorer. The component takes three props: `title`, `txHash`, and `blockExplorerBaseUrl`. \n\nThe `title` prop is a string that represents the title of the progress indicator. The `txHash` prop is an optional string that represents the transaction hash of the progress indicator. If `txHash` is provided, the component renders a cube icon; otherwise, it renders a wallet icon. The `blockExplorerBaseUrl` prop is an optional string that represents the base URL of the block explorer. \n\nThe component uses the `useNetwork` hook from the `wagmi` library to get the active chain. It then renders a `Flex` component with a column direction and some styles for alignment and spacing. The `Flex` component contains a `Text` component that renders the `title` prop, a `Box` component that renders the icon based on the `txHash` prop, and an `Anchor` component that renders the link to the block explorer. \n\nThe `Box` component uses the `FontAwesomeIcon` component from the `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` library to render the cube or wallet icon. The `Anchor` component uses the `activeChain` variable to get the name of the default block explorer for the active chain. If `txHash` is not provided, the `Anchor` component is hidden using the `visibility` CSS property.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger `zoo` project to show the progress of a transaction or an operation. For example, it can be used in a dashboard to show the progress of a deposit or a withdrawal. The `title` prop can be used to describe the operation, the `txHash` prop can be used to show the transaction hash, and the `blockExplorerBaseUrl` prop can be used to link to the block explorer. \n\nHere is an example of how to use the `Progress` component in a React component:\n\n```\nimport Progress from './Progress'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const txHash = '0x1234567890abcdef'\n  const blockExplorerBaseUrl = 'https://etherscan.io/'\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Progress\n        title=\"Deposit\"\n        txHash={txHash}\n        blockExplorerBaseUrl={blockExplorerBaseUrl}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code exports a React component called `Progress` that displays a title, an icon (either a cube or a wallet), and a link to a block explorer website.\n\n2. What are the required props for the `Progress` component?\n- The required prop is `title`, which is a string. The optional props are `txHash`, which is a string, and `blockExplorerBaseUrl`, which is a string.\n\n3. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?\n- This code imports several components from a custom library called `primitives`, as well as two icons from `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` and `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`. It also imports a hook called `useNetwork` from `wagmi`.",
