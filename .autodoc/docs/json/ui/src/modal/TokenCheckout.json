  "summary": "The `TokenCheckout` component in the `zoo` project is responsible for rendering a checkout summary for a list of items in a shopping cart. It takes in several props including the number of items in the cart, an array of images for the items, the total price of the items in cryptocurrency, the equivalent USD price, the currency type, the blockchain network, and the size of the component. \n\nThe component uses the `Flex` and `Text` components from the `primitives` module to create a layout that displays the item images and the item count on the left side of the component, and the total price and USD equivalent on the right side. The `FormatCryptoCurrency` component is used to format the cryptocurrency price with the appropriate currency symbol and decimal places, and the `FormatCurrency` component is used to display the USD equivalent price. \n\nThe `Img` component is used to display the item images in a horizontal row, with the first image aligned to the left and the subsequent images overlapping it slightly. The `size` prop is used to determine the size of the images and the font size of the text in the component. \n\nOverall, the `TokenCheckout` component is a reusable component that can be used in various parts of the `zoo` project to display a summary of items in a shopping cart. It provides a clean and organized layout that is easy to read and understand. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport { TokenCheckout } from 'zoo'\n\nconst items = [\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    name: 'Lion',\n    price: {\n      amount: 0.5,\n      currency: {\n        symbol: 'ZOO',\n        contract: '0x1234567890abcdef',\n        decimals: 18,\n      },\n    },\n    image: 'lion.jpg',\n  },\n  {\n    id: 2,\n    name: 'Elephant',\n    price: {\n      amount: 1.2,\n      currency: {\n        symbol: 'ZOO',\n        contract: '0x1234567890abcdef',\n        decimals: 18,\n      },\n    },\n    image: 'elephant.jpg',\n  },\n]\n\nconst totalPrice = items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.price.amount, 0)\n\nconst usdPrice = 0.05 // arbitrary USD price for 1 ZOO\n\nconst currency = items[0].price.currency\n\nconst chain = {\n  id: 1,\n  name: 'Ethereum',\n}\n\nconst CheckoutSummary = () => (\n  <TokenCheckout\n    itemCount={items.length}\n    images={items.map((item) => item.image)}\n    totalPrice={totalPrice}\n    usdPrice={usdPrice}\n    currency={currency}\n    chain={chain}\n    size=\"LG\"\n  />\n)\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TokenCheckout` component?\n- The `TokenCheckout` component is used to display information about a token purchase, including the number of items, images of the items, and the total price in both cryptocurrency and USD.\n\n2. What is the `Props` type and what props does the `TokenCheckout` component accept?\n- The `Props` type is an interface that defines the props accepted by the `TokenCheckout` component. These props include `itemCount`, `images`, `totalPrice`, `usdPrice`, `currency`, `chain`, and `size`.\n\n3. What external dependencies does this file rely on?\n- This file relies on two external dependencies: `@reservoir0x/reservoir-sdk` and `react`. It also imports several components and utilities from other files within the project.",
