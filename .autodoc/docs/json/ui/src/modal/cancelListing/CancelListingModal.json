  "summary": "The `CancelListingModal` component is a React modal that allows users to cancel a listing. It imports several hooks and components from other files in the project. The component takes in several props, including `openState`, `listingId`, `trigger`, `normalizeRoyalties`, `onClose`, `onCancelComplete`, and `onCancelError`. \n\nThe `CancelListingModal` component renders the `CancelListingModalRenderer` component, which is responsible for rendering the modal's content. The `CancelListingModalRenderer` component takes in several props, including `listingId`, `open`, and `normalizeRoyalties`. \n\nThe `CancelListingModal` component uses the `useFallbackState` hook to set the initial state of the modal to `false`. It also uses the `useReservoirClient` hook to get the current chain and the `useNetwork` hook to get the active chain. \n\nThe `CancelListingModal` component renders a `Modal` component from the `../Modal` file. The `Modal` component takes in several props, including `trigger`, `title`, `open`, `onOpenChange`, and `loading`. \n\nThe `CancelListingModal` component renders different content based on the value of `cancelStep`. If `cancelStep` is `CancelStep.Cancel`, the component renders a `TokenPrimitive` component from the `../TokenPrimitive` file, a message, and a `Button` component. If `cancelStep` is `CancelStep.Approving`, the component renders a `TokenPrimitive` component, a `Progress` component, and a `Button` component. If `cancelStep` is `CancelStep.Complete`, the component renders a message and a `Button` component. \n\nThe `CancelListingModal` component also includes two `useEffect` hooks. The first hook runs when `cancelStep` changes and calls `onCancelComplete` if `cancelStep` is `CancelStep.Complete`. The second hook runs when `transactionError` changes and calls `onCancelError` if `transactionError` exists. \n\nOverall, the `CancelListingModal` component is a reusable modal that allows users to cancel a listing. It uses several hooks and components from other files in the project and renders different content based on the value of `cancelStep`.",
