  "summary": "The `Fees` component is a React functional component that takes in two props: `fees` and `marketplace`. The `fees` prop is an object that contains an optional array of `feeBreakdown` objects. Each `feeBreakdown` object contains three optional properties: `kind`, `recipient`, and `bps`. The `marketplace` prop is a string that represents the name of the marketplace.\n\nThe purpose of this component is to display a breakdown of fees associated with a transaction. If there are no fees, the component returns `null`. Otherwise, it maps over the `feeBreakdown` array and creates a new array of objects that contain the fee name, percentage, and tooltip message. The percentage is calculated by multiplying the `bps` (basis points) by 0.01. The `name` and `tooltipMessage` properties are determined based on the `kind` property of each `feeBreakdown` object. If the `kind` is \"royalty\", the name is \"Creator Royalties\" and the tooltip message is \"A fee on every order that goes to the collection creator.\" If the `kind` is \"marketplace\", the name is set to `${marketplace} Fee` and the tooltip message is \"A fee included in the order from the marketplace in which it was created.\" If the `kind` is anything else, the name is \"Misc. Fees\".\n\nThe component then returns a `Flex` container that displays the fee breakdown. The container includes a `Text` component that displays \"Fees\" as a subtitle, followed by a list of fees. Each fee is displayed as a `Flex` container with the fee name and percentage displayed side-by-side. If a tooltip message is available, an `InfoTooltip` component is displayed next to the fee name.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display a breakdown of fees associated with a transaction. It can be customized to display different fee names and tooltip messages based on the `kind` property of each `feeBreakdown` object. The `marketplace` prop can be used to display the name of the marketplace where the transaction took place. An example usage of this component is as follows:\n\n```\n<Fees\n  fees={{\n    feeBreakdown: [\n      {\n        kind: 'royalty',\n        recipient: 'creator',\n        bps: 100,\n      },\n      {\n        kind: 'marketplace',\n        recipient: 'marketplace',\n        bps: 50,\n      },\n    ],\n  }}\n  marketplace=\"OpenSea\"\n/>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `Fees` component?\n    \n    The `Fees` component is used to display a breakdown of fees associated with a marketplace transaction.\n\n2. What is the `Props` type and what properties does it contain?\n    \n    The `Props` type is an interface that defines the expected shape of the `props` object passed to the `Fees` component. It contains two properties: `fees` and `marketplace`. `fees` is an object that may contain an array of `feeBreakdown` objects, each of which has a `kind`, `recipient`, and `bps` property. `marketplace` is a string that represents the name of the marketplace associated with the transaction.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `parsedFeeBreakdown` variable?\n    \n    The `parsedFeeBreakdown` variable is an array of objects that represent a parsed version of the `feeBreakdown` array passed to the `Fees` component. Each object in the array has a `name`, `percentage`, and `tooltipMessage` property that is used to display the fee information in the UI. The `name` property is a string that represents the name of the fee, the `percentage` property is a number that represents the percentage of the fee, and the `tooltipMessage` property is a string that provides additional information about the fee.",
