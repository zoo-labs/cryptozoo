  "summary": "The `Progress` component is a React functional component that renders a progress bar for a specific step in the process of accepting a bid on a marketplace. It takes in several props, including the current `acceptBidStep`, the `marketplace` object, and the `stepData` object. \n\nThe component uses the `useNetwork` hook from the `wagmi` library to get the current blockchain network. It then renders different content based on the current `acceptBidStep`. \n\nIf the `acceptBidStep` is `AcceptBidStep.ApproveMarketplace`, the component renders a progress bar that shows the progress of approving the marketplace to access the item in the user's wallet. It displays the name and image of the marketplace, as well as the current step in the approval process. If the `stepData` object is not null and the `totalSteps` property is greater than 2, it displays the current step's action. Otherwise, it displays a default message. It also displays a `TransactionProgress` component that shows the progress of the transaction from the user's wallet to the marketplace. Finally, it displays a description of the approval process.\n\nIf the `acceptBidStep` is `AcceptBidStep.Confirming`, the component displays a message asking the user to confirm the transaction in their wallet. It also displays an icon of a wallet.\n\nIf the `acceptBidStep` is `AcceptBidStep.Finalizing`, the component displays a message indicating that the transaction is being finalized on the blockchain. It also displays an icon of a cube and a link to view the transaction on Etherscan. \n\nOverall, this component is used to provide feedback to the user about the progress of accepting a bid on a marketplace. It displays different content based on the current step in the process and provides information about the marketplace and the transaction. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\n<Progress\n  acceptBidStep={AcceptBidStep.ApproveMarketplace}\n  etherscanBaseUrl=\"https://etherscan.io/\"\n  marketplace={{\n    name: \"Marketplace\",\n    image: \"https://example.com/marketplace.png\"\n  }}\n  tokenImage=\"https://example.com/token.png\"\n  stepData={{\n    totalSteps: 3,\n    currentStep: {\n      action: \"Approving transaction\",\n      description: \"Please approve the transaction to proceed.\"\n    }\n  }}\n/>\n```",
