  "summary": "The `TransactionBidDetails` component is a React functional component that renders a section of a user interface for displaying details about a bid on a token. It takes in three props: `token`, `collection`, and `bidData`. \n\nThe `token` prop is an object that contains information about the token being bid on. The `collection` prop is an object that contains information about the collection that the token belongs to. The `bidData` prop is an object that contains information about the bid, including the offer price, the currency used for the bid, and the expiration time of the bid.\n\nThe component uses several other components and hooks from the project to render the UI. The `TokenStatsHeader` component is used to display information about the token and collection at the top of the section. The `SelectedAttribute` component is used to display information about the attribute of the token being bid on. The `FormatWrappedCurrency` component is used to format the offer price of the bid.\n\nThe `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the `value` variable, which is used to store the formatted offer price of the bid. The `useTimeSince` hook is used to calculate the time since the bid expiration time.\n\nThe component renders a `Flex` container that contains the `TokenStatsHeader` component and a `Box` container. The `Box` container contains the `SelectedAttribute` component and a `Flex` container that displays the offer price and expiration time of the bid. The `Flex` container uses the `FormatWrappedCurrency` component to display the offer price and the `useTimeSince` hook to display the expiration time.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display details about a bid on a token. It can be used in conjunction with other components and hooks from the project to create a complete user interface for buying and selling tokens. For example, it could be used in a bidding interface that allows users to bid on tokens in a collection.",
  "questions": "1. What are the required props for the `TransactionBidDetails` component?\n- The required props for the `TransactionBidDetails` component are `collection` of type `NonNullable<ReturnType<typeof useCollections>['data']>[0]` and `bidData` of type `BidData | null`. An optional prop `token` of type `NonNullable<NonNullable<ReturnType<typeof useTokens>>['data']>['0']` is also available.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?\n- The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `value` state variable with the formatted ether price from the `bidData` prop whenever the `bidData` prop changes.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `SelectedAttribute` component in this code?\n- The `SelectedAttribute` component is used to display the attribute key and value of the selected bid data.",
