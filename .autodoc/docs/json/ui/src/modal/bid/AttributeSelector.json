  "summary": "The `AttributeSelector` component is a React functional component that renders a modal for selecting attributes. It receives several props, including `attributes`, `setTrait`, and `setOpen`. \n\nThe `attributes` prop is an array of objects that represent the available attributes. Each object has a `key` property and a `values` property. The `key` property is a string that represents the name of the attribute, and the `values` property is an array of objects that represent the possible values for that attribute. Each object in the `values` array has a `value` property, which is a string that represents the value of the attribute, a `count` property, which is a number that represents the number of tokens that have that attribute value, and a `floorAskPrice` property, which is a number that represents the lowest ask price for a token with that attribute value.\n\nThe `setTrait` prop is a function that takes an object with `key`, `value`, and `floorAskPrice` properties and sets the selected trait.\n\nThe `setOpen` prop is a function that takes a boolean value and sets whether the modal is open or closed.\n\nThe component renders a modal with a search input and a list of attributes and their values. The search input allows the user to filter the list of attributes and values by typing in a search query. The list of attributes and values is rendered using the `Grid` component from the `primitives` module. Each attribute is rendered as a section with a title, and each value is rendered as a button. When a value button is clicked, the `setTrait` function is called with the `key`, `value`, and `floorAskPrice` properties of the selected value, and the modal is closed by calling the `setOpen` function with a value of `false`.\n\nOverall, the `AttributeSelector` component is a reusable component that can be used to select attributes for tokens in a larger project. It provides a user-friendly interface for selecting attributes and values, and it allows the user to filter the list of attributes and values to find the desired attribute.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `AttributeSelector` component?\n- The `AttributeSelector` component is used to render a list of selectable attributes with their corresponding values, and allows the user to filter the list by typing in a search query.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `setTrait` and `setOpen` props?\n- The `setTrait` prop is a function that sets the selected trait when an attribute value is clicked, while the `setOpen` prop is a function that controls the visibility of the modal that contains the `AttributeSelector` component.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useAttributes` hook?\n- The `useAttributes` hook is used to fetch and return a list of attributes and their corresponding values from an external data source. The `attributes` prop passed to the `AttributeSelector` component is the result of calling this hook.",
