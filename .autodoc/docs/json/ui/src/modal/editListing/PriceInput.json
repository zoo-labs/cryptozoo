  "summary": "The `PriceInput` component is a React component that renders an input field for a marketplace listing price. It takes in several props, including `price`, `collection`, `currency`, `usdPrice`, `quantity`, `onChange`, and `onBlur`. \n\nThe `price` prop is the current price of the listing, while the `collection` prop is an object containing information about the collection that the listing belongs to. The `currency` prop is an object containing information about the currency used for the listing price, including the currency's contract address, symbol, and number of decimals. The `usdPrice` prop is the current USD price of the currency used for the listing price. The `quantity` prop is the number of items being listed. The `onChange` and `onBlur` props are functions that are called when the input field's value changes and when the input field loses focus, respectively.\n\nThe component calculates the profit that the seller will make from the listing based on the listing price, the collection's royalty percentage, and the number of items being listed. It then renders the input field for the listing price, along with the currency symbol and icon. It also renders the calculated profit in both the cryptocurrency and USD formats.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project that involves a marketplace for buying and selling items. It can be used to allow sellers to set the price for their listings and to display the potential profit that they will make from each listing. It can also be used to convert the listing price from cryptocurrency to USD, making it easier for buyers to understand the price of the item. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport PriceInput from './PriceInput'\n\nfunction ListingForm() {\n  const [price, setPrice] = useState(0)\n  const [currency, setCurrency] = useState({ symbol: 'ETH', contract: '0x123abc', decimals: 18 })\n  const [usdPrice, setUsdPrice] = useState(0)\n\n  const handlePriceChange = (e) => {\n    setPrice(e.target.value)\n  }\n\n  const handlePriceBlur = (e) => {\n    // Call API to update listing price\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <form>\n      <PriceInput\n        price={price}\n        currency={currency}\n        usdPrice={usdPrice}\n        onChange={handlePriceChange}\n        onBlur={handlePriceBlur}\n      />\n    </form>\n  )\n}\n```",
