  "summary": "The `EditListingModal` component is a React modal that allows users to edit an existing listing. It imports several hooks and components from other files in the project, including `useFallbackState`, `useTimeSince`, `Flex`, `Text`, `Box`, `Button`, `Loader`, `Select`, `EditListingModalRenderer`, `Modal`, `TokenPrimitive`, `Progress`, `FontAwesomeIcon`, `faCheckCircle`, `faCircleExclamation`, `PriceInput`, `InfoTooltip`, and `constants`. \n\nThe component takes in several props, including `openState`, `listingId`, `tokenId`, `collectionId`, `trigger`, `normalizeRoyalties`, `enableOnChainRoyalties`, `onClose`, `onEditListingComplete`, and `onEditListingError`. \n\nThe `EditListingModal` component renders the `EditListingModalRenderer` component, which is responsible for rendering the actual modal content. The `EditListingModalRenderer` component takes in several props, including `listingId`, `tokenId`, `collectionId`, `open`, `normalizeRoyalties`, and `enableOnChainRoyalties`. \n\nThe `EditListingModalRenderer` component renders different content depending on the value of `editListingStep`. If `editListingStep` is `Edit`, the component renders a form that allows users to edit the listing's price, quantity, and expiration date. If `editListingStep` is `Approving`, the component renders a progress bar that shows the status of the transaction. If `editListingStep` is `Complete`, the component renders a success message. \n\nThe `EditListingModal` component also includes several helper functions that are used to calculate the profit, updated total USD, and expiration time of the listing. These functions are called within the `EditListingModalRenderer` component. \n\nOverall, the `EditListingModal` component is an important part of the larger project as it allows users to edit their listings, which is a key feature of the platform.",
