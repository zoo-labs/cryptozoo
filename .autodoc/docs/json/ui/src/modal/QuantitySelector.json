  "summary": "The `QuantitySelector` component is a reusable React component that provides a user interface for selecting a quantity within a given range. It takes in several props, including `max`, `min`, `quantity`, and `setQuantity`, which are used to determine the range of valid quantities and to update the selected quantity. \n\nThe component is composed of three main elements: two buttons for incrementing and decrementing the quantity, and an input field for displaying and editing the current quantity. The buttons are styled using the `QuantityButton` component, which is a styled version of the `Button` component from the `../primitives` directory. The input field is styled using the `QuantityInput` component, which is a styled version of the `input` HTML element.\n\nThe `QuantitySelector` component uses the `PseudoInput` component to group the buttons and input field together and apply additional styling. The `PseudoInput` component is a custom component that wraps the `div` HTML element and applies some additional styles to make it look like an input field.\n\nWhen the user clicks on the increment or decrement buttons, the `setQuantity` function is called with the new quantity value. The `onChange` and `onBlur` event handlers on the input field are used to update the quantity when the user types in a new value or leaves the input field. If the user enters an invalid value, such as a value outside of the valid range or a non-numeric value, the quantity is not updated.\n\nOverall, the `QuantitySelector` component provides a simple and reusable way to allow users to select a quantity within a given range. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as in an e-commerce application for selecting the quantity of a product to purchase. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport QuantitySelector from './QuantitySelector'\n\nfunction ProductPage() {\n  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1)\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <h1>Product Name</h1>\n      <p>Price: $10.00</p>\n      <QuantitySelector\n        min={1}\n        max={10}\n        quantity={quantity}\n        setQuantity={setQuantity}\n      />\n      <button>Add to Cart</button>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n- This code exports a React component called `QuantitySelector` that renders a quantity selector UI element with buttons to increment and decrement the quantity and an input field to display and edit the quantity.\n\n2. What are the required props for the `QuantitySelector` component?\n- The `QuantitySelector` component requires four props: `max` (number), `min` (number), `quantity` (number), and `setQuantity` (function that takes a number as argument and returns void). It also accepts an optional `css` prop for custom styling.\n\n3. What external libraries or components are used in this code?\n- This code imports several components and libraries: `React` and `CSSProperties` from the `react` package, `Button` from a custom `../primitives` module, `PseudoInput` from another custom `../primitives/PseudoInput` module, `styled` from a custom `../../stitches.config` module, and `FontAwesomeIcon`, `faMinus`, and `faPlus` from the `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` and `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` packages.",
