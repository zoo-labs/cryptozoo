  "summary": "The code defines a React functional component called `SweepItem`. This component takes in four props: `name`, `image`, `amount`, and `currency`. The `name` prop is a string that represents the name of the item being swept. The `image` prop is a string that represents the URL of the image of the item being swept. The `amount` prop is a number that represents the amount of the item being swept. The `currency` prop is an object that is returned from the `useChainCurrency` hook.\n\nThe purpose of this component is to display a single item that is being swept. The item is displayed as a small card with the item's image, name, and amount. The card is wrapped in a tooltip that displays the item's name when the user hovers over the card.\n\nThe component uses several other components from the `primitives` module, including `Flex`, `FormatCryptoCurrency`, `Img`, and `Text`. The `Flex` component is used to create a container for the card that allows for flexible layout. The `Img` component is used to display the item's image. The `Text` component is used to display the item's name in the tooltip. The `FormatCryptoCurrency` component is used to format the item's amount as a cryptocurrency value.\n\nThe `SweepItem` component is likely used in a larger project that involves sweeping multiple items. It could be used in a wallet application that allows users to sweep multiple types of cryptocurrencies into their wallet. The component could be reused for each type of cryptocurrency being swept, with the `name`, `image`, `amount`, and `currency` props being passed in for each type.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useChainCurrency` hook and how is it used in this code?\n- The `useChainCurrency` hook is used to retrieve information about a specific cryptocurrency chain, and it is passed as a prop to the `SweepItem` component.\n2. What is the expected format of the `image` prop and how is it used in this code?\n- The `image` prop is expected to be a string representing the URL of an image, and it is used as the `src` attribute of an `Img` component.\n3. What is the purpose of the `Tooltip` component and how is it configured in this code?\n- The `Tooltip` component is used to display a tooltip when the user hovers over the `Flex` component. It is configured to display the `name` prop as the content of the tooltip, and to position the tooltip above the `Flex` component with a small offset.",
