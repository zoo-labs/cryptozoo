  "summary": "The code above defines a React functional component called `ItemToggle`. This component is responsible for rendering a toggle group with two buttons: one for toggling between \"Items\" and \"Currency\". The component receives three props: `isItemsToggled`, `setIsItemsToggled`, and `currency`. \n\nThe `isItemsToggled` prop is a boolean value that determines whether the \"Items\" button is currently selected or not. The `setIsItemsToggled` prop is a function that updates the `isItemsToggled` prop. The `currency` prop is an object that is returned from the `useChainCurrency` hook. \n\nThe `ToggleGroup` component is a custom component that is imported from the `primitives` module. It renders a group of toggle buttons and manages their state. The `type` prop is set to \"single\", which means that only one button can be selected at a time. The `value` prop is set to either \"items\" or \"currency\", depending on the value of `isItemsToggled`. The `onValueChange` prop is a callback function that is called when the user clicks on one of the buttons. If the value of the clicked button is \"items\", then `setIsItemsToggled` is called with `true`. Otherwise, it is called with `false`.\n\nThe `ToggleGroupButton` component is a custom component that is also imported from the `primitives` module. It renders a single toggle button. The `value` prop is set to either \"items\" or \"currency\", depending on which button is being rendered. The `css` prop is an object that contains CSS styles for the button. The `Text` component is another custom component that is imported from the `primitives` module. It renders a text element with a specific style. The `style` prop is set to \"subtitle2\", which is a predefined style in the `primitives` module. The `css` prop is an object that contains CSS styles for the text element. The text content of the \"Items\" button is hard-coded, while the text content of the \"Currency\" button is dynamically generated from the `currency` prop.\n\nOverall, this component is a reusable toggle group that can be used to switch between two different modes in a larger project. The `isItemsToggled` prop can be used to determine which mode is currently active, while the `setIsItemsToggled` prop can be used to update the active mode. The `currency` prop can be used to display the current currency symbol in the \"Currency\" button. Here is an example of how this component can be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport { useChainCurrency } from '../hooks'\nimport { ItemToggle } from '../components'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const [isItemsToggled, setIsItemsToggled] = useState(true)\n  const currency = useChainCurrency()\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <ItemToggle\n        isItemsToggled={isItemsToggled}\n        setIsItemsToggled={setIsItemsToggled}\n        currency={currency}\n      />\n      {isItemsToggled ? <ItemList /> : <CurrencyConverter />}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, `MyComponent` renders an `ItemToggle` component and either an `ItemList` or a `CurrencyConverter` component, depending on the value of `isItemsToggled`. The `currency` prop is passed down from the `useChainCurrency` hook. The `isItemsToggled` and `setIsItemsToggled` props are used to manage the state of the toggle group.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ItemToggle` component?\n- The `ItemToggle` component is a toggle group that allows the user to switch between displaying items or currency.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `useChainCurrency` hook?\n- The `useChainCurrency` hook is used to retrieve the currency data for the current chain.\n\n3. What is the expected behavior when the user clicks on one of the toggle buttons?\n- When the user clicks on one of the toggle buttons, the `isItemsToggled` state is updated to reflect the user's selection. If the user selects \"items\", `isItemsToggled` is set to `true`, otherwise it is set to `false`.",
