  "summary": "The `TransactionProgress` component is a React functional component that displays a progress bar for a transaction. It takes in two props: `fromImg`, which is a string representing the image source of the sender, and `toImgs`, which is an array of strings representing the image sources of the recipients. The component is built using the `Flex` and `Box` primitives from the `../primitives` module, which are used to create a flexible layout for the progress bar.\n\nThe `Img` component is a styled component that renders an image with a fixed width and height, a border radius of 4, and object-fit set to cover. It is used to display the sender and recipient images in the progress bar. The `ProgressDot` component is another styled component that renders a small circle with a border radius of 50%, a width and height of 5, and a background color. It is used to display the progress dots in the progress bar.\n\nThe `loadingStart`, `loadingMiddle`, and `loadingEnd` keyframes are CSS animations that define the animation for the progress dots. They use the `$neutralSolid` and `$accentText` colors from the `stitches.config` module to create a pulsing effect on the dots.\n\nThe `TransactionProgress` component renders a `Flex` container with the `fromImg` image on the left, the progress dots in the middle, and the `toImgs` images on the right. The progress dots are rendered using the `ProgressDot` component with the `loadingStart`, `loadingMiddle`, and `loadingEnd` animations applied to them. The `toImgs` images are rendered using the `Img` component in a loop.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project to display the progress of a transaction, such as a payment or transfer of funds. It provides a visual representation of the transaction progress and can be customized with different images and colors to match the project's branding. Here is an example of how the `TransactionProgress` component can be used:\n\n```\n<TransactionProgress\n  fromImg=\"/images/sender.png\"\n  toImgs={[\n    \"/images/recipient1.png\",\n    \"/images/recipient2.png\",\n    \"/images/recipient3.png\"\n  ]}\n/>\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code exports a React component called `TransactionProgress` that displays a progress bar with three dots that animate using CSS keyframes.\n\n2. What are the dependencies of this code?\n   - This code imports `Box` and `Flex` components from a file located at `../primitives`, as well as `React` and `ComponentPropsWithoutRef` from the `react` package. It also imports `styled` and `keyframes` functions from a file located at `../../stitches.config`.\n\n3. What are the props accepted by the `TransactionProgress` component?\n   - The `TransactionProgress` component accepts two props: `fromImg`, which is a string representing the source URL of an image to display on the left side of the progress bar, and `toImgs`, which is an array of strings representing the source URLs of images to display on the right side of the progress bar. It also accepts all props that can be passed to a `Flex` component.",
