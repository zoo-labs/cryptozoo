  "summary": "This code defines a React component called `Modal` that renders a dialog box with a title, content, and optional back button. The component is designed to be used as a reusable UI element in a larger project. \n\nThe `Modal` component is built using the `@radix-ui/react-dialog` library, which provides a set of primitives for building accessible dialog boxes. The `Modal` component also uses several other React components from the project, including `Anchor`, `Button`, `Flex`, `Text`, `Loader`, and `Box`. \n\nThe `Modal` component takes several props, including `title`, `children`, `trigger`, `onBack`, `open`, `size`, `onOpenChange`, `loading`, `onPointerDownOutside`, and `onFocusCapture`. The `title` prop is a string that sets the title of the dialog box. The `children` prop is a React node that sets the content of the dialog box. The `trigger` prop is a React element that triggers the opening of the dialog box. The `onBack` prop is a function that is called when the back button is clicked. The `open` prop is a boolean that determines whether the dialog box is open or closed. The `size` prop is an enum that sets the size of the dialog box. The `onOpenChange` prop is a function that is called when the open state of the dialog box changes. The `loading` prop is a boolean that determines whether a loading spinner is displayed. The `onPointerDownOutside` and `onFocusCapture` props are functions that handle pointer and focus events, respectively. \n\nThe `Modal` component also defines a `Logo` component that renders the Reservoir logo. The `Logo` component is used in the `Modal` component to display the \"Powered by Reservoir\" logo in the footer of the dialog box. \n\nOverall, the `Modal` component provides a flexible and reusable way to display dialog boxes in a React project. Here is an example of how the `Modal` component might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport { Modal, ModalSize } from './Modal'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false)\n\n  const handleOpen = () => {\n    setIsOpen(true)\n  }\n\n  const handleClose = () => {\n    setIsOpen(false)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      <Button onClick={handleOpen}>Open Modal</Button>\n      <Modal\n        title=\"My Modal\"\n        open={isOpen}\n        onOpenChange={handleClose}\n        size={ModalSize.LG}\n        trigger={<Button>Open Modal</Button>}\n      >\n        <p>This is the content of my modal.</p>\n      </Modal>\n    </>\n  )\n}\n```",
