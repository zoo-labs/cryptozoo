  "summary": "The code above defines a React functional component called `SigninStep` that renders a sign-in step for the Blur application. The component imports the `FontAwesomeIcon` and `Flex` components from external libraries and the `Text` component from an internal library called `primitives`. It also imports the `faPenNib` icon from the `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` library and the `CSS` type from the `@stitches/react` library.\n\nThe `SigninStep` component takes a single prop called `css` of type `CSS`, which is used to style the component. The component renders a `Flex` container with a column direction, centered content, and a neutral text color. The container includes two `Text` components that display the sign-in message and a description of the approval process. Finally, the component renders a `FontAwesomeIcon` component that displays the `faPenNib` icon.\n\nThis component can be used in the larger project as a step in the sign-in process for the Blur application. It provides a simple and visually appealing interface for users to sign in and complete the approval process. The `css` prop allows for customization of the component's styling to fit the overall design of the application.\n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\nimport SigninStep from './SigninStep'\n\nfunction SigninPage() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <SigninStep css={{ marginTop: 20 }} />\n      {/* other sign-in steps */}\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
