  "summary": "This code exports various modules, hooks, themes, and components that are part of the larger project called \"zoo\". \n\nThe \"Providers\" section exports two providers: \"ReservoirKitProvider\" and \"ReservoirClientProvider\". These providers are likely used to provide data and functionality to other parts of the project. \n\nThe \"Hooks\" section exports a variety of hooks that can be used throughout the project. These hooks include \"useCollections\", \"useTokens\", \"useBids\", and many others. Hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic across components in React, so these hooks likely provide some common functionality that is used throughout the project. \n\nThe \"Themes\" section exports two themes: \"lightTheme\" and \"darkTheme\". These themes likely define the color scheme and styling for various components in the project. \n\nThe \"Components\" section exports a variety of components that can be used throughout the project. These components include modals for buying, bidding, and listing items, as well as components for displaying token media and managing a user's cart. \n\nOverall, this code exports a variety of modules, hooks, themes, and components that are likely used throughout the larger \"zoo\" project. Developers working on the project can import and use these exports as needed to build out the functionality and user interface of the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport { useCollections } from 'zoo';\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const { collections, loading, error } = useCollections();\n\n  if (loading) {\n    return <div>Loading collections...</div>;\n  }\n\n  if (error) {\n    return <div>Error loading collections: {error.message}</div>;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {collections.map(collection => (\n        <div key={collection.id}>{collection.name}</div>\n      ))}\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the \"useCollections\" hook is imported from the \"zoo\" project and used to fetch and display a user's collections. The hook returns an object with the collections, loading state, and any errors that occurred during the fetch. The collections are then mapped over and displayed in the component.",
