  "summary": "This code defines a set of CSS properties for a flexible container element using the Stitches library. The `flexCss` object contains properties for `display`, `boxSizing`, `borderStyle`, and `borderWidth`, as well as several variants for `align`, `justify`, `direction`, and `wrap`. These variants allow for different alignment, justification, direction, and wrapping options for the flexible container element.\n\nThe `styled` function from the Stitches library is used to create two styled components: a default `div` element and an `AnimatedFlex` component that uses the `motion` library from Framer Motion. Both components use the `flexCss` object to define their CSS properties.\n\nThis code can be used in the larger project to create flexible container elements with different alignment, justification, direction, and wrapping options. For example, the `AnimatedFlex` component can be used to create animated flexible container elements with the same set of options. Here is an example of how the `AnimatedFlex` component can be used:\n\n```\nimport { AnimatedFlex } from 'zoo'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <AnimatedFlex\n      align=\"center\"\n      justify=\"between\"\n      direction=\"row\"\n      wrap=\"wrap\"\n    >\n      {/* child elements */}\n    </AnimatedFlex>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nThis creates an animated flexible container element with centered alignment, space between justification, horizontal direction, and wrapping enabled. The child elements can be added inside the `AnimatedFlex` component and will be laid out according to the specified options.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `framer-motion` library being imported?\n- The `framer-motion` library is being imported to allow for animation of the `div` element.\n\n2. What is the purpose of the `styled` function being imported from `stitches.config`?\n- The `styled` function is being used to create a styled `div` element with the `flexCss` styles.\n\n3. What are the different variants being defined in the `flexCss` object?\n- The `flexCss` object defines variants for `align`, `justify`, `direction`, and `wrap` styles for the `flex` display.",
