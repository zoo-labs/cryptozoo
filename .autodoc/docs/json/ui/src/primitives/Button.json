  "summary": "The code defines a styled button component using the Stitches CSS-in-JS library. The component can be customized using variants for color, corners, and size. The `color` variant can be set to `primary`, `secondary`, or `ghost`, with corresponding styles for each. The `corners` variant can be set to `rounded`, `pill`, or `circle`, with corresponding border radius styles. The `size` variant can be set to `none`, `xs`, `small`, `medium`, or `large`, with corresponding padding, line-height, and min-height styles.\n\nThe `compoundVariants` array defines additional styles for the button when certain combinations of variants are used. For example, when the `size` variant is set to `xs` and the `corners` variant is set to `circle`, the button will have a height and width of 40px and no padding.\n\nThe `defaultVariants` object sets the default values for the `color`, `corners`, and `size` variants.\n\nThis button component can be used throughout the larger project to provide a consistent look and feel for buttons. Developers can easily customize the button by passing in different variant values. For example, to create a large, secondary button with pill corners, the following code could be used:\n\n```\n<Button color=\"secondary\" corners=\"pill\" size=\"large\">Click me</Button>\n```",
