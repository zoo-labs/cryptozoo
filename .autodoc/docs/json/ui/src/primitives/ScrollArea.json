  "summary": "The code defines a custom scrollable area component called `RKScrollArea` using the `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area` package and the `stitches.config` file. The component has a fixed height of 322 pixels, a border radius of `$space$2`, and a box shadow of `0 2px 10px $inputBackground`. It also has a transparent background color and inherits the border radius of its parent element. \n\nThe `RKScrollArea` component has four child components: `ScrollAreaViewport`, `ScrollAreaScrollbar`, `ScrollAreaThumb`, and `ScrollAreaCorner`. The `ScrollAreaViewport` component is the container for the scrollable content. The `ScrollAreaScrollbar` component is the container for the scroll bar and has two orientations: vertical and horizontal. The `ScrollAreaThumb` component is the draggable handle of the scrollbar. The `ScrollAreaCorner` component is the corner where the vertical and horizontal scrollbars meet.\n\nThe `RKScrollArea` component takes in any children components and passes them to the `ScrollAreaViewport` component. The `ScrollAreaScrollbar` component has two `orientation` props: `vertical` and `horizontal`. The `ScrollAreaThumb` component is a child of the `ScrollAreaScrollbar` component and is responsible for the draggable handle of the scrollbar. The `ScrollAreaCorner` component is a child of the `ScrollArea` component and is responsible for the corner where the vertical and horizontal scrollbars meet.\n\nThe `RKScrollArea` component can be used in any part of the project where a custom scrollable area is needed. For example, it can be used in a long list of items where the user needs to scroll through the list. The component can be styled using the `stitches.config` file to match the design of the project. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport RKScrollArea from './path/to/RKScrollArea'\n\nconst longList = ['item1', 'item2', 'item3', ...]\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <RKScrollArea>\n      {longList.map(item => (\n        <div key={item}>{item}</div>\n      ))}\n    </RKScrollArea>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a custom scrollable area component with styled scrollbars and a corner element.\n\n2. What external dependencies does this code have?\n   - This code imports `styled` and `CSSProps` from a `stitches.config` file, as well as several components from the `@radix-ui/react-scroll-area` library.\n\n3. What is the significance of the `SCROLLBAR_SIZE` constant?\n   - This constant defines the width or height (depending on orientation) of the scrollbars used in the component.",
