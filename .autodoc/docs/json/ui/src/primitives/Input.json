  "summary": "The `Input` component in this file is a custom input field that can be used in a React application. It is built using the `styled` function from the `stitches.config` file, which allows for the creation of custom styles for HTML elements. \n\nThe `StyledInput` component is created using the `styled` function and is passed an `'input'` string as its first argument. This creates a new component that is an input field with custom styles. The styles include resetting all default styles with `all: 'unset'`, setting the width to `100%`, adding padding, setting the border radius, font family, font size, and text color. The background color is set to `$inputBackground`, which is a variable defined in the `stitches.config` file. The `$$focusColor` variable is also defined in the `stitches.config` file and is used to set the color of the input field when it is in focus. \n\nThe `StyledInput` component also includes styles for the placeholder text and focus state. Additionally, there are styles for removing the up and down arrows on number inputs in webkit browsers and for displaying number inputs as text fields in Firefox. \n\nThe `Input` component is then created using the `forwardRef` function from React. This allows the `ref` to be passed to the `StyledInput` component. The `Input` component also accepts several props, including `icon`, `containerCss`, and `iconCss`. The `icon` prop is used to add an icon to the input field, the `containerCss` prop is used to add custom styles to the container of the input field, and the `iconCss` prop is used to add custom styles to the icon. \n\nThe `Input` component is a wrapper around the `StyledInput` component and includes the ability to add an icon to the input field. The `icon` prop is passed to a `Box` component that is absolutely positioned within the container of the input field. The `StyledInput` component is then rendered within a `Flex` component, which allows for the icon and input field to be displayed side by side. \n\nOverall, this file provides a reusable `Input` component that can be used throughout a React application. It includes custom styles for the input field and the ability to add an icon to the input field.",

What props can be passed to the `Input` component?\n- The `Input` component accepts props for the input element, as well as additional props for an optional icon and custom styling for the container and icon. These props are passed as an object with the `icon`, `containerCss`, and `iconCss` properties.",
