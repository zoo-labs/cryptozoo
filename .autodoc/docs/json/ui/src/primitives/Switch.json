  "summary": "This code defines a custom switch component using React and the Stitches CSS-in-JS library. The switch is based on the `@radix-ui/react-switch` primitive component. \n\nThe `StyledSwitch` component is a styled version of the `SwitchPrimitive.Root` component. It sets various CSS properties such as width, height, background color, and border radius. It also defines a focus color variable and applies it when the switch is focused. When the switch is checked, the background color changes to an accent color defined in the Stitches config. \n\nThe `Thumb` component is a styled version of the `SwitchPrimitive.Thumb` component. It sets the width, height, background color, and border radius of the switch thumb. It also defines a transition for the transform property, which is used to animate the thumb when the switch is checked. \n\nThe `Switch` component is a functional component that renders the `StyledSwitch` component with a `Thumb` component as its child. It accepts optional props that can be passed down to the `StyledSwitch` component. \n\nThis code can be used in a larger project that requires a custom switch component with specific styling. The `StyledSwitch` and `Thumb` components can be further customized by modifying their CSS properties or adding new ones. The `Switch` component can be used anywhere in the project where a switch is needed, and its props can be used to control its behavior. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport Switch from './Switch'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false)\n\n  const handleSwitchChange = () => {\n    setIsChecked(!isChecked)\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Switch checked={isChecked} onChange={handleSwitchChange} />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a custom switch component using React and the Radix UI library.\n\n2. What are the styles applied to the switch component?\n   The switch component has a width of 46, a height of 24, a rounded border, and a background color that changes when checked. The thumb of the switch has a width and height of 20, a rounded border, and a background color that also changes when checked. The switch has a focus style that adds a box shadow and a border color.\n\n3. What are the dependencies of this code?\n   This code depends on React, the Stitches CSS-in-JS library, and the Radix UI library.",
