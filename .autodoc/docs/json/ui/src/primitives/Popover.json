  "summary": "The code defines a custom React component called `RKPopover` that wraps the `Popover` component from the `@radix-ui/react-popover` library. The `RKPopover` component takes in several props, including `content`, `side`, and `width`, which are used to customize the appearance and behavior of the popover.\n\nThe `RKPopover` component renders a `Popover.Root` component that contains a `Popover.Trigger` and a `Popover.Content`. The `Popover.Trigger` component is a wrapper around the `children` prop, which is passed in as a child of the `RKPopover` component. The `Popover.Content` component contains an `Arrow` component and a `Box` component that wraps the `content` prop.\n\nThe `Arrow` component is a custom styled component that renders a small arrow that points to the `Popover.Trigger` component. The `Box` component is another custom styled component that wraps the `content` prop and applies some styles to it, including padding, a maximum width, and a background color.\n\nThe `RKPopover` component is designed to be used as a customizable popover that can be triggered by clicking on a button or other element. The `content` prop can be used to pass in any React node, such as text, images, or other components, that will be displayed inside the popover. The `side` prop can be used to specify which side of the trigger element the popover should appear on, and the `width` prop can be used to specify the width of the popover.\n\nHere is an example of how the `RKPopover` component might be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport RKPopover from './components/RKPopover'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <RKPopover content={<div>Hello, world!</div>} side=\"right\" width=\"200px\">\n        <button>Click me!</button>\n      </RKPopover>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `RKPopover` component is used to create a popover that appears to the right of a button when it is clicked. The `content` prop is set to a simple `div` element that contains the text \"Hello, world!\", and the `width` prop is set to 200 pixels.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the zoo project?\n   This code defines a custom popover component called `RKPopover` that is used to display content in a popover. It is likely used throughout the zoo project wherever a popover is needed.\n\n2. What is the significance of the `styled` function and how is it used in this code?\n   The `styled` function is used to create custom styled components for the `Arrow` and `Content` components of the popover. It allows for easy customization of the appearance of these components using CSS-in-JS syntax.\n\n3. What are the available props for the `RKPopover` component and how are they used?\n   The available props for the `RKPopover` component include `content`, `side`, and `width`, which are used to specify the content to display in the popover, the side of the trigger element to display the popover on, and the width of the popover, respectively. These props are passed down to the `Popover` components as well as the custom `Box` component used to display the content.",
