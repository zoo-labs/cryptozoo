  "summary": "This code exports a function that retrieves a list of asks (sell orders) from a Reservoir API endpoint. The function takes in three parameters: `options`, `swrOptions`, and `enabled`, as well as an optional `chainId`. \n\n`options` is an object that contains query parameters to be sent with the API request. `swrOptions` is an object that contains options for the SWR library, which is used to handle caching and revalidation of the API response. `enabled` is a boolean that determines whether the API request should be made or not. `chainId` is an optional parameter that specifies which blockchain network to make the API request on.\n\nThe function first retrieves the Reservoir client using the `useReservoirClient` hook. It then determines which blockchain network to make the API request on based on the `chainId` parameter. If `chainId` is not specified, it defaults to the current chain of the Reservoir client.\n\nThe function then uses the `useInfiniteApi` hook to make the API request. This hook takes in a function that generates the API request URL and returns an array containing the URL, API key, and client version. The function also handles pagination by passing in a `pageIndex` parameter and `previousPageData` object. If pagination is not enabled or there is no more data to fetch, the function returns null.\n\nThe API response is then flattened and the `orders` property of each page is extracted into a single array of listings. This array is returned along with the SWR response object.\n\nThis function can be used to retrieve a list of asks from the Reservoir API and display them in a UI component. The `options` parameter can be used to filter the results based on various criteria, such as token ID or price. The `swrOptions` parameter can be used to customize the caching and revalidation behavior of the response. The `enabled` parameter can be used to conditionally fetch data based on user input or other factors. The `chainId` parameter can be used to fetch data from a specific blockchain network.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `useReservoirClient` function and how is it used in this code?\n- A smart developer might ask what the `useReservoirClient` function does and how it is used in this code. \n- `useReservoirClient` is a custom hook that returns a client object with methods for interacting with a Reservoir API. It is used to retrieve the current chain and base API URL for the client.\n\n2. What is the `useInfiniteApi` function and how is it used in this code?\n- A smart developer might ask what the `useInfiniteApi` function does and how it is used in this code. \n- `useInfiniteApi` is a custom hook that fetches data from an API endpoint using SWR (React's data fetching library). It is used to fetch data for the `Asks` type and `AsksQuery` type.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `listings` variable and how is it generated?\n- A smart developer might ask what the `listings` variable is used for and how it is generated. \n- `listings` is an array of orders retrieved from the API endpoint. It is generated by flattening the `orders` array from each page of data returned by the `useInfiniteApi` hook. If there is no data, it defaults to an empty array.",
