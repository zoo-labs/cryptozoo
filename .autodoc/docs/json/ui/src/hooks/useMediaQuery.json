  "summary": "The code defines a custom React hook called `useMediaQuery` that allows developers to check if a given CSS media query matches the current viewport. The hook takes a single argument, `query`, which is a string representing the media query to be evaluated.\n\nThe hook uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React to manage state and side effects. The `useState` hook initializes a boolean value `matches` to `false`. The `useEffect` hook is used to subscribe to changes in the media query and update the `matches` state accordingly.\n\nInside the `useEffect` hook, the `window.matchMedia` method is used to create a new `MediaQueryList` object that represents the given `query`. The `matches` property of the `MediaQueryList` object is then compared to the current value of `matches` state. If they are different, the `setMatches` function is called to update the state.\n\nA listener function is also defined that updates the `matches` state whenever the `change` event is fired on the `MediaQueryList` object. This listener is added to the `MediaQueryList` object using the `addEventListener` method. Finally, the `useEffect` hook returns a cleanup function that removes the listener using the `removeEventListener` method.\n\nThe `useMediaQuery` hook is intended to be used in other React components to conditionally render content based on the result of the media query. For example, a component could use the hook to determine if the viewport is wide enough to display a sidebar, and only render the sidebar if the media query matches.\n\nHere is an example usage of the `useMediaQuery` hook:\n\n```\nimport useMediaQuery from './useMediaQuery'\n\nconst MyComponent = () => {\n  const isWide = useMediaQuery('(min-width: 768px)')\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      {isWide ? <Sidebar /> : null}\n      <Content />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, the `MyComponent` component uses the `useMediaQuery` hook to check if the viewport width is at least 768 pixels. If it is, the `Sidebar` component is rendered, otherwise it is not. The `Content` component is always rendered.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   This code defines a custom React hook called `useMediaQuery` that returns a boolean value indicating whether a given media query matches the current viewport.\n\n2. How does this code handle changes to the media query?\n   The code sets up a listener for changes to the media query using `addEventListener` and updates the `matches` state using `setMatches` whenever the query matches change.\n\n3. What dependencies does this code have?\n   This code imports `useEffect` and `useState` from the `react` library, indicating that it is intended to be used within a React application.",
