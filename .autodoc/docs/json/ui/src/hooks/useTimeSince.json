  "summary": "This code is a React component that calculates the time elapsed since a given timestamp and returns it as a string. It uses the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks from React to manage state and side effects.\n\nThe `dayjs` library is used to handle date and time calculations. Specifically, the `relativeTime` plugin is imported and extended to allow for the calculation of relative time (e.g. \"2 hours ago\").\n\nThe function takes an optional `timestamp` parameter, which is a Unix timestamp (i.e. the number of seconds since January 1, 1970). If a `timestamp` is provided, the `useEffect` hook is triggered and the `timeSince` state is updated with the relative time elapsed since the given timestamp. If no `timestamp` is provided, the `timeSince` state is set to an empty string.\n\nThe component can be used in a larger project to display the time elapsed since a certain event occurred. For example, it could be used in a social media app to show how long ago a post was made or in an e-commerce app to show how long ago an order was placed.\n\nHere is an example of how this component could be used in a React component:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react'\nimport TimeSince from './TimeSince'\n\nfunction Post({ timestamp }) {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Posted {<TimeSince timestamp={timestamp} />} ago</p>\n      <p>This is a post</p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Post\n```\n\nIn this example, the `TimeSince` component is used to display the time elapsed since the post was made. The `timestamp` prop is passed to the component to calculate the relative time.",
  "questions": "1. What does this code do?\n   This code exports a function that takes in a timestamp and returns a string representing the time since that timestamp in relative time (e.g. \"2 hours ago\").\n\n2. What libraries are being used in this code?\n   This code imports two libraries: `react` and `dayjs`. It also imports a specific plugin from `dayjs` called `relativeTime`.\n\n3. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?\n   The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `timeSince` state variable whenever the `timestamp` prop changes. If `timestamp` is not provided, `timeSince` is set to an empty string.",
