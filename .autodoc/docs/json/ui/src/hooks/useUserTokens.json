  "summary": "This code exports a default function that retrieves a list of tokens for a given user from a Reservoir API endpoint. The function takes in four parameters: `user`, `options`, `swrOptions`, and `chainId`. \n\nThe `user` parameter is a string that represents the user whose tokens are being retrieved. The `options` parameter is an optional object that contains query parameters to be included in the API request. The `swrOptions` parameter is an optional object that contains configuration options for the SWR library, which is used to cache and manage the API response. The `chainId` parameter is an optional number that represents the ID of the blockchain network to use for the API request.\n\nThe function first retrieves the Reservoir client object using the `useReservoirClient` hook. It then determines the blockchain network to use based on the `chainId` parameter or the current network of the client object. \n\nThe function then uses the `useInfiniteApi` hook from the `./` module to make the API request. This hook takes in a callback function that is called each time a new page of data is requested. The callback function constructs the API endpoint URL using the `user` parameter and the `chain` object, and sets the query parameters using the `options` object. If there is previous page data available, the callback function adds the `continuation` parameter to the query to retrieve the next page of data. The callback function also sets the `normalizeRoyalties` parameter in the query if it is not already set and the client object has a `normalizeRoyalties` property.\n\nThe `useInfiniteApi` hook returns an object that contains the API response data, including an array of token objects. The function extracts this array from the response and returns it along with the other properties of the response object.\n\nThis function can be used in the larger project to retrieve a list of tokens for a given user from the Reservoir API. The function can be called with the `user` parameter and optionally with the `options`, `swrOptions`, and `chainId` parameters to customize the API request and response caching behavior. The returned token array can then be used to display the user's tokens in the application.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?\n   \n   This code exports a function that retrieves user tokens from a Reservoir API endpoint. It uses the Reservoir SDK and SWR library to handle API requests and pagination.\n\n2. What parameters does the exported function take and what are their types?\n   \n   The exported function takes four parameters: `user` (string or undefined), `options` (UserTokenQuery or false), `swrOptions` (SWRInfiniteConfiguration), and `chainId` (number or undefined). \n\n3. What is the structure of the response data returned by the exported function?\n   \n   The response data returned by the exported function is an object that includes the data returned by the Reservoir API endpoint. The `data` property of the response object is an array of user tokens, and the other properties of the response object are metadata related to the API request and pagination.",
