  "summary": "The code above defines a TypeScript type called `Currency`. This type is used to represent a cryptocurrency and contains the following properties:\n\n- `contract`: a string representing the contract address of the cryptocurrency.\n- `symbol`: a string representing the ticker symbol of the cryptocurrency.\n- `decimals`: an optional number representing the number of decimal places used by the cryptocurrency. If this property is not provided, it defaults to 18.\n- `coinGeckoId`: an optional string representing the ID of the cryptocurrency on the CoinGecko platform.\n\nThis type can be used throughout the larger project to represent different cryptocurrencies. For example, if the project has a feature that allows users to view the prices of different cryptocurrencies, the `Currency` type can be used to represent each cryptocurrency and its associated information.\n\nHere is an example of how the `Currency` type can be used in TypeScript code:\n\n```\nimport { Currency } from 'zoo';\n\nconst bitcoin: Currency = {\n  contract: '0x123abc...',\n  symbol: 'BTC',\n  decimals: 8,\n  coinGeckoId: 'bitcoin'\n};\n\nconst ethereum: Currency = {\n  contract: '0x456def...',\n  symbol: 'ETH',\n  coinGeckoId: 'ethereum'\n};\n```\n\nIn this example, we import the `Currency` type from the `zoo` module. We then create two `Currency` objects, one representing Bitcoin and the other representing Ethereum. The `bitcoin` object has a `decimals` property of 8, while the `ethereum` object does not have a `decimals` property and therefore defaults to 18.\n\nOverall, the `Currency` type defined in this code is a useful tool for representing cryptocurrencies in the larger project.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code and where is it being used in the project?\n   This code defines a TypeScript type called `Currency` which has properties for contract, symbol, decimals, and coinGeckoId. It is likely being used throughout the project to represent different currencies.\n\n2. What is the expected format for the `contract` and `symbol` properties?\n   The code does not provide any information on the expected format for these properties. It would be helpful to have additional documentation or comments explaining what values are valid for these properties.\n\n3. When is the `decimals` property used and what does it represent?\n   The `decimals` property is optional and it is unclear from the code when it is used and what it represents. Additional documentation or comments would be helpful to clarify its purpose.",
