  "summary": "This code defines a TypeScript type called `ExpirationOption`. This type is used to represent an option for an expiration date in a larger project called `zoo`. \n\nThe `ExpirationOption` type has four properties: `text`, `value`, `relativeTime`, and `relativeTimeUnit`. The `text` property is a string that represents the text to be displayed for the option. The `value` property is a string that represents the value of the option. The `relativeTime` property is a number or null that represents the relative time of the option. The `relativeTimeUnit` property is a `ManipulateType` or null that represents the unit of the relative time.\n\nThis type can be used in various parts of the `zoo` project where expiration options need to be represented. For example, it could be used in a form where users can select an expiration option for a particular animal exhibit. \n\nHere is an example of how this type could be used in code:\n\n```\nimport { ExpirationOption } from 'zoo'\n\nconst options: ExpirationOption[] = [\n  {\n    text: '1 day',\n    value: '1',\n    relativeTime: 1,\n    relativeTimeUnit: 'day'\n  },\n  {\n    text: '1 week',\n    value: '7',\n    relativeTime: 1,\n    relativeTimeUnit: 'week'\n  },\n  {\n    text: '1 month',\n    value: '30',\n    relativeTime: 1,\n    relativeTimeUnit: 'month'\n  }\n]\n\n// Use the options in a form\n<select>\n  {options.map(option => (\n    <option key={option.value} value={option.value}>\n      {option.text}\n    </option>\n  ))}\n</select>\n```\n\nIn this example, an array of `ExpirationOption` objects is defined and then used to populate a dropdown select element in a form. The `text` property of each option is displayed as the text of the option in the select element, and the `value` property is used as the value of the option.",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `ExpirationOption` type?\n   - The `ExpirationOption` type is used to represent an option for an expiration date, including its text, value, relative time, and relative time unit.\n\n2. What is the `ManipulateType` import used for?\n   - The `ManipulateType` import is used to define the type of the `relativeTimeUnit` property in the `ExpirationOption` type.\n\n3. What other files or modules might depend on this code?\n   - Other files or modules that deal with expiration dates or options in the `zoo` project might depend on this code, as well as any external libraries that use the `ExpirationOption` type.",
