  "summary": "This code exports a React component that renders an SVG image of a stylized arrow. The arrow is composed of six path elements, each with a different fill color. The arrow is oriented vertically and has a triangular shape with a wider base at the bottom. The SVG element has a dynamic width and a fixed height of 100% of its container. The viewBox attribute defines the coordinate system used to draw the paths, and the xmlns attribute specifies the XML namespace for SVG elements.\n\nThis component can be used in a larger project as a visual element to indicate direction or movement. It can be styled and positioned using CSS to fit the design of the application. Here is an example of how to use this component in a React application:\n\n```\nimport React from 'react';\nimport Arrow from './Arrow';\n\nconst App = () => (\n  <div>\n    <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>\n    <Arrow />\n  </div>\n);\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nIn this example, the Arrow component is imported and rendered inside a div element. The resulting output will be the arrow image displayed below the heading.",
