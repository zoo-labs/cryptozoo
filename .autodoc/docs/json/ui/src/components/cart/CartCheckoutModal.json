  "summary": "The `CartCheckoutModal` component is a React component that renders a modal for the checkout process of a shopping cart. It receives several props that contain information about the items in the cart, the total price, the currency, the chain, and the transaction status. \n\nThe component uses several other components and libraries to render the modal, including `DialogPrimitive`, `framer-motion`, `@stitches/react`, and `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`. It also uses several custom components from the project, such as `TokenCheckout`, `SigninStep`, and `ApprovalCollapsible`.\n\nThe modal has several states depending on the transaction status. If the status is `Approving`, the modal shows a list of items to be approved, and the user is prompted to sign in to their wallet. If the status is `Finalizing`, the modal shows a message indicating that the transaction is being finalized on the blockchain. If the status is `Complete`, the modal shows a message indicating whether the transaction was successful or not, and provides a link to view the transaction on the blockchain.\n\nThe component also uses several hooks to retrieve data and manage state, such as `useContext`, `useState`, `useEffect`, and custom hooks like `useCoinConversion`. \n\nOverall, the `CartCheckoutModal` component is an important part of the shopping cart feature of the project, providing a user-friendly interface for the checkout process and integrating with various blockchain-related libraries and services. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```jsx\n<CartCheckoutModal\n  items={cartItems}\n  totalPrice={totalPrice}\n  usdPrice={usdPrice}\n  currency={currency}\n  cartChain={cartChain}\n  blockExplorerBaseUrl={blockExplorerBaseUrl}\n  transaction={transaction}\n  open={isModalOpen}\n  setCartPopoverOpen={setCartPopoverOpen}\n/>\n```",
