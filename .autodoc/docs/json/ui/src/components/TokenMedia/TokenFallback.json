  "summary": "The `TokenFallback` component is a React functional component that renders a fallback UI for when content is not available for a given token. It takes in several props, including `style`, `className`, `token`, `chainId`, and `onRefreshClicked`. \n\nThe component first uses the `useReservoirClient` hook to get the current client instance, and then uses the `chainId` prop to determine which chain to use. If `chainId` is not provided, it defaults to the current chain. \n\nThe component then renders a `Flex` container with `justify`, `align`, and `direction` props set to center the child elements. The `gap` and `aspectRatio` CSS properties are also set on the container. \n\nInside the container, the component conditionally renders an `img` element if the `token` prop has a `collection` object with an `image` property. The image is displayed with a width and height of 64 pixels, and a border radius of 8 pixels. \n\nNext, a `Text` component is rendered with the text \"No Content Available\". The `style` prop is set to \"body2\", and the `textAlign` CSS property is set to center the text. \n\nFinally, a `Button` component is rendered with the text \"Refresh\". When clicked, the `onRefreshClicked` prop is called, and a POST request is made to the Reservoir API to refresh the token. The request includes the `token` ID in the request body, and the `Content-Type` header is set to \"application/json\". \n\nThis component can be used in the larger project as a fallback UI for when content is not available for a given token. It provides a way for users to refresh the token content if it becomes stale. \n\nExample usage:\n\n```\nimport TokenFallback from './TokenFallback'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <TokenFallback\n        token={{ collection: { id: '123', image: 'https://example.com/image.png' }, tokenId: '456' }}\n        onRefreshClicked={() => console.log('Refresh clicked')}\n      />\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of the `TokenFallback` component?\n- The `TokenFallback` component is a fallback UI for when there is no content available for a token.\n\n2. What is the `useReservoirClient` hook and where is it defined?\n- The `useReservoirClient` hook is defined in the `../../hooks` module and is used to retrieve the Reservoir client instance.\n\n3. What is the `paths` object imported from `@reservoir0x/reservoir-sdk` used for?\n- The `paths` object is used to define the types for the request and response parameters for the `/tokens/refresh/v1` endpoint.",
