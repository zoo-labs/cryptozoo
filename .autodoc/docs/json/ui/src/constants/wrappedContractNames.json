  "summary": "The code above defines a constant variable called `wrappedContractNames` which is a Record object that maps numbers to strings. The purpose of this code is to provide a mapping between the network IDs of various Ethereum-based blockchains and the names of the wrapped tokens used on those networks. \n\nThe keys of the `wrappedContractNames` object are the network IDs, and the values are the names of the wrapped tokens used on those networks. For example, the network ID 1 is associated with the wrapped Ether token (WETH), while the network ID 137 is associated with the wrapped Matic token (WMATIC). \n\nThis code is likely used in other parts of the larger project to facilitate the use of wrapped tokens across different Ethereum-based blockchains. For example, if a user wants to interact with a smart contract on the Polygon network (network ID 137), they would need to use WMATIC instead of WETH. By referencing the `wrappedContractNames` object, the project can easily determine which wrapped token to use for a given network ID. \n\nHere is an example of how this code might be used in another part of the project:\n\n```\nimport wrappedContractNames from 'zoo'\n\nconst networkId = 137\nconst wrappedTokenName = wrappedContractNames[networkId]\n\n// Use wrappedTokenName to interact with smart contracts on the Polygon network\n``` \n\nIn this example, the `wrappedContractNames` object is imported from the `zoo` module. The code then retrieves the name of the wrapped token associated with the Polygon network (network ID 137) by accessing the `wrappedContractNames` object with the network ID as the key. The resulting `wrappedTokenName` variable can then be used to interact with smart contracts on the Polygon network.",
  "questions": "1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\\\nA smart developer might ask what this code is used for and how it fits into the overall functionality of the `zoo` project. Based on the code, it appears to be defining a mapping of contract names to contract numbers for various tokens.\n\n2. **What is the significance of the numbers used as keys in the `wrappedContractNames` object?**\\\nA smart developer might ask why specific numbers were chosen as keys in the `wrappedContractNames` object. Based on the code, it seems that each number corresponds to a specific blockchain or network.\n\n3. **What is the reason for exporting `wrappedContractNames` as the default export?**\\\nA smart developer might ask why `wrappedContractNames` is being exported as the default export of the `zoo` module. Based on the code, it seems that this mapping of contract names to contract numbers is a fundamental piece of data that may be used throughout the `zoo` project.",
