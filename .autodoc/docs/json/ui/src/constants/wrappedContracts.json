  "summary": "This code defines a constant variable called `wrappedContracts` which is a Record object that maps numbers to Ethereum contract addresses. The numbers represent different Ethereum networks, with 1 being the main Ethereum network, 5 being the Goerli test network, 10 being the Optimism network, 137 being the Polygon network, and 42161 being the Arbitrum network. The corresponding contract addresses are for wrapped versions of various tokens, which are tokens that have been \"wrapped\" to be compatible with a different network or protocol.\n\nThis code is likely used in the larger project to provide a centralized location for storing the contract addresses of wrapped tokens on different networks. Other parts of the project can import this file and use the `wrappedContracts` object to interact with the wrapped tokens on the appropriate network. For example, if a user wants to trade a wrapped token on the Polygon network, the code can reference the contract address stored in `wrappedContracts[137]` to interact with that token.\n\nHere is an example of how this code could be used in a larger project:\n\n```\nimport wrappedContracts from './zoo/wrappedContracts'\n\nconst polygonWrappedTokenAddress = wrappedContracts[137]\n// Use the polygonWrappedTokenAddress to interact with the wrapped token on the Polygon network\n```",
  "questions": "1. What is the purpose of this code?\n   - This code defines a constant object `wrappedContracts` that maps network IDs to contract addresses.\n\n2. What is the data type of `wrappedContracts` and what does it represent?\n   - `wrappedContracts` is a `Record` type with keys of type `number` and values of type `string`. It represents a mapping of network IDs to contract addresses.\n\n3. Where is this code being used/imported?\n   - It is being exported as a default export from the `zoo` module, so it can be imported and used in other parts of the project that depend on it.",
