This code defines a constant object called `NATIVE` that maps each chain ID to a corresponding native token object. The native token object for each chain ID is created by calling the `onChain` method of the appropriate entity class from the `../entities/Native` module. 

The `../entities/Native` module contains classes for each supported blockchain network, such as `Avalanche`, `Binance`, `Celo`, `Ether`, `Fantom`, `Fuse`, `Harmony`, `Heco`, `Matic`, `Movr`, `Okex`, `Palm`, and `xDai`. Each of these classes has a `onChain` method that returns a token object for the specified chain ID.

The `ChainId` enum is imported from the `../enums` module and is used as the keys for the `NATIVE` object. The `ChainId` enum contains constants for each supported chain ID, such as `MAINNET`, `ROPSTEN`, `RINKEBY`, `GÃ–RLI`, `KOVAN`, `FANTOM`, `FANTOM_TESTNET`, `MATIC`, `MATIC_TESTNET`, `XDAI`, `BSC`, `BSC_TESTNET`, `ARBITRUM`, `AVALANCHE`, `AVALANCHE_TESTNET`, `HECO`, `HECO_TESTNET`, `HARMONY`, `HARMONY_TESTNET`, `OKEX`, `OKEX_TESTNET`, `CELO`, `PALM`, `MOONRIVER`, `FUSE`, `HARDHAT`, and `HARDHAT2`.

This code can be used to retrieve the native token object for a specific chain ID in a decentralized application. For example, if a DApp needs to interact with the native token on the Ethereum mainnet, it can retrieve the token object by calling `NATIVE[ChainId.MAINNET]`. This token object can then be used to perform various operations, such as transferring tokens or querying the token balance. 

Here is an example of how this code can be used in a larger project:

```javascript
import { NATIVE, ChainId } from 'zoo'

// Retrieve the native token object for the Ethereum mainnet
const etherMainnet = NATIVE[ChainId.MAINNET]

// Transfer 1 ETH to a recipient address
await etherMainnet.transfer('0x123...', '1')

// Get the balance of the current account
const balance = await etherMainnet.balanceOf('0x456...')
console.log(`Current balance: ${balance}`)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Native` module and how is it used in the project?
- The `Native` module contains definitions for various blockchain networks and their corresponding native currencies. It is used to provide a standardized way of referencing these currencies across the project.

2. What is the significance of the `ChainId` enum and how is it related to the `NATIVE` object?
- The `ChainId` enum is used to identify different blockchain networks. It is used as a key in the `NATIVE` object to map each network to its corresponding native currency.

3. Are there any other currencies or networks that could be added to the `NATIVE` object?
- It is possible that new currencies or networks could be added to the `NATIVE` object in the future, as long as they are supported by the `Native` module. However, this would require updating the code to include the new mappings.
