This code defines a set of constants and exports them for internal consumption within the larger project. The constants are all BigInt values created using the JSBI library, which provides support for arbitrary-precision integers in JavaScript. 

The most notable constant defined in this code is `MaxUint256`, which represents the maximum value of a 256-bit unsigned integer. This constant may be used in various parts of the project where such a value is needed, such as in cryptographic operations or in defining the maximum value of a data type. 

The other constants defined in this code are mostly used for convenience and readability. For example, `ZERO`, `ONE`, and `TWO` represent the BigInt values 0, 1, and 2 respectively, and may be used in place of those values throughout the project. Similarly, `_100`, `_997`, and `_1000` represent the BigInt values 100, 997, and 1000 respectively. 

Overall, this code serves to provide a set of commonly used BigInt constants for use within the larger project. Here is an example of how one of these constants might be used:

```
import { ONE } from 'zoo'

function addOne(num) {
  return JSBI.add(num, ONE)
}

const result = addOne(JSBI.BigInt(5))
console.log(result) // outputs 6
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `JSBI` library being imported?
- The `JSBI` library is being used to work with BigIntegers in JavaScript.

2. What is the significance of the `MaxUint256` constant?
- The `MaxUint256` constant represents the maximum value of an unsigned 256-bit integer.

3. What is the purpose of the other exported constants (`ZERO`, `ONE`, etc.)?
- These constants are likely being used as predefined values for mathematical operations or other calculations within the `zoo` project.
