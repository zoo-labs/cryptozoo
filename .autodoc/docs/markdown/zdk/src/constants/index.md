This code exports various constants and functions related to the zoo project. 

The `ChainId` enum is imported from the `enums` module, and `JSBI` is imported from the `jsbi` library. The code then exports various modules, including `addresses`, `kashi`, `natives`, `numbers`, `tokens`, and `currencyMap`. These modules likely contain functions and constants related to addresses, lending and borrowing, native tokens, numbers, tokens, and currency mapping, respectively.

The `INIT_CODE_HASH` constant is defined as an object with keys corresponding to each chain ID in the `ChainId` enum. The value for each key is a string representing a hash. This constant is likely used to initialize contracts on different chains with the same bytecode.

The `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` constant is defined as a `JSBI` BigInt with a value of 1000. This constant is likely used to set a minimum liquidity threshold for liquidity providers.

The `SolidityType` enum is defined with two values: `uint8` and `uint256`. The `SOLIDITY_TYPE_MAXIMA` constant is defined as an object with keys corresponding to each value in the `SolidityType` enum. The value for each key is a `JSBI` BigInt representing the maximum value for that type. These constants are likely used to ensure that values passed to contracts do not exceed the maximum value for their respective types.

The `LAMBDA_URL` and `SOCKET_URL` constants are defined as strings representing URLs. These constants are likely used to connect to external services for data retrieval or communication.

Overall, this code exports various constants and functions that are likely used throughout the zoo project to interact with contracts, handle numbers and tokens, and connect to external services.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `INIT_CODE_HASH` constant and why is it defined as an object with keys corresponding to different `ChainId`s?
- The `INIT_CODE_HASH` constant is likely used to initialize smart contracts on different chains, and it is defined as an object with keys corresponding to different `ChainId`s so that the correct hash can be used for each chain.
2. What is the significance of the `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` constant and why is it defined using `JSBI.BigInt`?
- The `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY` constant likely represents the minimum amount of liquidity that can be added to a pool, and it is defined using `JSBI.BigInt` to ensure that it is represented as an integer with arbitrary precision.
3. What are the `LAMBDA_URL` and `SOCKET_URL` constants used for?
- The `LAMBDA_URL` and `SOCKET_URL` constants are likely used to connect to external services, with `LAMBDA_URL` being a URL for an AWS Lambda function and `SOCKET_URL` being a WebSocket URL.
