The code above defines a class called `Heco` that extends another class called `NativeCurrency`. The purpose of this class is to represent the native currency of the Huobi Token (HT) blockchain, which is called "Huobi Token" and has a symbol of "HT". The `Heco` class has a constructor that takes a `chainId` parameter, which is used to identify the blockchain network that this currency belongs to. The `Heco` class also has a method called `wrapped` that returns a `Token` object representing the wrapped version of this currency. 

The `Heco` class has a private static property called `_cache`, which is an object that maps blockchain network IDs to instances of the `Heco` class. This property is used to cache instances of the `Heco` class so that they can be reused later if needed. The `Heco` class has a static method called `onChain` that takes a `chainId` parameter and returns an instance of the `Heco` class for the specified blockchain network. If an instance for the specified network already exists in the cache, it is returned. Otherwise, a new instance is created and added to the cache before being returned.

The `Heco` class also has a method called `equals` that takes another `Currency` object as a parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the two objects are equal. Two currency objects are considered equal if they are both native currencies and belong to the same blockchain network.

This code is part of a larger project called "zoo" that likely deals with blockchain-related functionality. The `Heco` class is used to represent the native currency of the Huobi Token blockchain and provides methods for working with this currency and comparing it to other currencies. Other parts of the "zoo" project may use this class to perform transactions or other operations involving the Huobi Token currency. 

Example usage:

```
const heco = Heco.onChain(128) // create or retrieve an instance of Heco for the Huobi Token network with ID 128
const wrapped = heco.wrapped // get the wrapped version of the Huobi Token currency
const isNative = heco.equals(heco) // true, since heco is a native currency and belongs to the same network as itself
const isNotNative = heco.equals(Token.ETH) // false, since Token.ETH is not a native currency and does not belong to the same network as heco
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a class called `Heco` which extends another class called `NativeCurrency`. It provides functionality for working with the Huobi Token (HT) on a specific blockchain network.

2. What is the significance of the `wrapped` method and how is it used?
- The `wrapped` method returns a `Token` object representing the wrapped version of the native currency on the current blockchain network. It is used to facilitate the exchange of the native currency with other tokens on the network.

3. What is the purpose of the `_cache` property and how does it improve performance?
- The `_cache` property is a static object that stores instances of the `Heco` class for each blockchain network. When the `onChain` method is called with a specific chain ID, it checks if an instance for that chain ID already exists in the cache and returns it if it does. This improves performance by avoiding the need to create a new instance of the class every time it is needed.
