The code above defines a class called `Matic` that extends another class called `NativeCurrency`. The purpose of this class is to represent the native currency of the Matic network, which is called "MATIC". 

The `Matic` class has a constructor that takes in a `chainId` parameter, which is used to initialize the `NativeCurrency` superclass with the appropriate values for the Matic network. Specifically, the `super()` call sets the `chainId` to the provided value, the `decimals` to 18 (which is the standard for most cryptocurrencies), the `symbol` to "MATIC", and the `name` to "Matic". 

The `Matic` class also has a `wrapped` method that returns a `Token` object representing the wrapped version of the native currency. This is done by looking up the appropriate `WNATIVE` token for the current `chainId` and returning it. If the `WNATIVE` token is not found for the current `chainId`, an error is thrown using the `invariant()` function from the `tiny-invariant` library. 

The `Matic` class also has a static `_cache` property that is used to store instances of the `Matic` class for each `chainId`. The `onChain()` method is a static method that takes in a `chainId` parameter and returns the corresponding `Matic` instance from the cache if it exists, or creates a new instance and adds it to the cache if it does not. This is done to ensure that only one instance of the `Matic` class exists for each `chainId`, which can help with performance and memory usage. 

Finally, the `Matic` class has an `equals()` method that takes in another `Currency` object and returns `true` if the object is a native currency on the same chain as the `Matic` instance, or `false` otherwise. This method is used to compare currencies in other parts of the project. 

Overall, the `Matic` class provides a convenient way to represent the native currency of the Matic network and to interact with it in a standardized way. It also provides a caching mechanism to improve performance and memory usage. Here is an example of how the `Matic` class might be used in the larger project:

```
import { Matic } from './zoo/Matic'

const matic = Matic.onChain(137) // create or retrieve Matic instance for chainId 137
const wrappedMatic = matic.wrapped // get wrapped version of Matic
const isNativeMatic = matic.equals(wrappedMatic) // false
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   This code defines a class called `Matic` which extends another class called `NativeCurrency`. It provides functionality for working with the Matic network's native currency and its wrapped version.

2. What is the significance of the `wrapped` method and how is it used?
   The `wrapped` method returns a `Token` object representing the wrapped version of the Matic currency on the current chain. It is used to interact with the wrapped version of the currency in various operations.

3. What is the purpose of the `_cache` property and how is it used?
   The `_cache` property is a static object that stores instances of the `Matic` class for each chain ID. It is used to ensure that only one instance of the class is created for each chain ID, and to provide a way to retrieve that instance later on.
