The code above defines a class called `Fantom` that extends another class called `NativeCurrency`. The purpose of this class is to represent the native currency of the Fantom blockchain. 

The `Fantom` class has a constructor that takes in a `chainId` parameter and calls the constructor of the `NativeCurrency` class with the `chainId`, a decimal value of 18, a symbol of 'FTM', and a name of 'Fantom'. The `chainId` parameter is used to identify the specific blockchain network that this currency belongs to. 

The `Fantom` class also has a method called `wrapped` that returns a `Token` object. This method retrieves the wrapped version of the native currency for the specific blockchain network that this `Fantom` object belongs to. The wrapped version of the native currency is represented by the `WNATIVE` constant, which is imported from another file. If the `WNATIVE` constant for the specific `chainId` does not exist, an error is thrown using the `invariant` function from the `tiny-invariant` library. 

The `Fantom` class also has a static method called `onChain` that takes in a `chainId` parameter and returns a `Fantom` object for that specific `chainId`. This method uses a private static property called `_cache` to store previously created `Fantom` objects for each `chainId`. If a `Fantom` object for the specific `chainId` already exists in the cache, it is returned. Otherwise, a new `Fantom` object is created for that `chainId` and added to the cache before being returned. 

Finally, the `Fantom` class has an `equals` method that takes in another `Currency` object and returns a boolean indicating whether the two objects are equal. This method checks if the other `Currency` object is a native currency and has the same `chainId` as the `Fantom` object. 

Overall, this code provides a way to represent the native currency of the Fantom blockchain and retrieve the wrapped version of that currency for a specific blockchain network. It also provides a way to cache `Fantom` objects for each `chainId` to avoid unnecessary object creation. This class can be used in the larger project to handle transactions involving the native currency of the Fantom blockchain. 

Example usage:

```
const fantom = Fantom.onChain(250) // create a Fantom object for chainId 250
const wrapped = fantom.wrapped // retrieve the wrapped version of the native currency for chainId 250
const equals = fantom.equals(otherCurrency) // check if the Fantom object is equal to another Currency object
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   This code defines a class called Fantom which extends NativeCurrency and provides functionality for working with the FTM currency on the Fantom blockchain. It also provides a way to get the wrapped version of FTM and caches instances of the class for each chain ID.

2. What is the significance of the `invariant` function and how is it used in this code?
   The `invariant` function is used to check that the `wnative` variable is truthy, and if not, it throws an error with the message 'WRAPPED'. This is used to ensure that the `wnative` variable is defined and prevent errors from occurring later in the code.

3. How does the `equals` method work and what is its purpose?
   The `equals` method takes another Currency object as an argument and returns a boolean indicating whether it is equal to the current object. It checks if the other object is a native currency on the same chain ID as the current object and returns true if it is, false otherwise. This method is used for comparing currencies in other parts of the code.
