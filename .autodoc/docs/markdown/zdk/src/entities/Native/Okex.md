The code above defines a class called `Okex` that extends another class called `NativeCurrency`. The purpose of this class is to represent the native currency of the OKExChain blockchain, which is called OKT. 

The `Okex` class has a constructor that takes in a `chainId` parameter and calls the constructor of its parent class `NativeCurrency` with the same parameter, along with two additional parameters: `18` and `'OKT'`. The `18` parameter represents the number of decimal places in which the currency is divisible, and the `'OKT'` parameter represents the symbol of the currency. The constructor also sets the name of the blockchain to `'OKExChain'`.

The `Okex` class has a method called `wrapped` that returns a `Token` object representing the wrapped version of the native currency. The wrapped version is obtained from a constant called `WNATIVE` that is imported from another file. The method also checks if the wrapped version exists for the current `chainId` and throws an error if it does not.

The `Okex` class has a static method called `onChain` that takes in a `chainId` parameter and returns an instance of the `Okex` class for that `chainId`. The method uses a static cache object to store instances of the `Okex` class for each `chainId`, so that if an instance has already been created for a particular `chainId`, it is returned from the cache instead of creating a new instance.

Finally, the `Okex` class has a method called `equals` that takes in a `Currency` object and returns a boolean indicating whether the object is equal to the native currency represented by the `Okex` class. The method checks if the `Currency` object is native and has the same `chainId` as the `Okex` instance.

This code can be used in the larger project to represent and manipulate the native currency of the OKExChain blockchain. For example, it can be used to create instances of the `Okex` class for different `chainId`s, get the wrapped version of the currency, and check if a given `Currency` object is equal to the native currency represented by the `Okex` class.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a class called `Okex` which extends another class called `NativeCurrency` and provides methods to interact with the OKExChain native currency.

2. What is the significance of the `wrapped` method?
   The `wrapped` method returns a `Token` object representing the wrapped version of the native currency on the current chain. It throws an error if the wrapped token is not defined for the current chain.

3. What is the purpose of the `_cache` property and the `onChain` method?
   The `_cache` property is a static object that stores instances of the `Okex` class for each chain ID. The `onChain` method returns the cached instance for a given chain ID if it exists, otherwise it creates a new instance and caches it before returning it. This is done to avoid creating multiple instances of the same currency on the same chain.
