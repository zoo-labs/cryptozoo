The code above defines a class called `Celo` that extends another class called `NativeCurrency`. The purpose of this class is to represent the native currency of the Celo blockchain. 

The `Celo` class has a constructor that takes in a `chainId` parameter and calls the constructor of the `NativeCurrency` class with a `decimals` value of 18, a `symbol` value of 'CELO', and a `name` value of 'Celo'. The `chainId` parameter is used to set the `chainId` property of the `NativeCurrency` class.

The `Celo` class also has a `wrapped` method that returns a `Token` object representing the wrapped version of the native currency. This method retrieves the wrapped currency from a constant called `WNATIVE` using the `chainId` property of the `Celo` instance. If the wrapped currency is not found, an error is thrown using the `invariant` function from the `tiny-invariant` library.

The `Celo` class has a static `_cache` property that is an object with keys representing different `chainId` values and values representing instances of the `Celo` class. The purpose of this cache is to avoid creating multiple instances of the `Celo` class for the same `chainId`.

The `Celo` class also has a static `onChain` method that takes in a `chainId` parameter and returns an instance of the `Celo` class for that `chainId`. If an instance for the given `chainId` already exists in the cache, it is returned. Otherwise, a new instance is created and added to the cache.

Finally, the `Celo` class has an `equals` method that takes in a `Currency` object and returns a boolean indicating whether the given object is a native currency with the same `chainId` as the `Celo` instance.

This code can be used in the larger project to represent and interact with the native currency of the Celo blockchain. For example, it can be used to retrieve the wrapped version of the native currency or to check whether a given currency object is a native currency with the same `chainId`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   This code defines a class called `Celo` which extends another class called `NativeCurrency`. It provides functionality for working with the CELO currency on different blockchain networks.

2. What is the significance of the `wrapped` method and how is it used?
   The `wrapped` method returns a `Token` object representing the wrapped version of CELO on the current blockchain network. It is used to interact with the wrapped version of CELO in smart contracts.

3. What is the purpose of the `_cache` property and how is it used?
   The `_cache` property is a static object that stores instances of the `Celo` class for different blockchain networks. It is used to avoid creating multiple instances of the `Celo` class for the same network, which can be expensive. The `onChain` method checks if an instance for the given network already exists in the cache and returns it if it does, otherwise it creates a new instance and adds it to the cache.
