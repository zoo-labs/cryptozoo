The code above defines a class called Avalanche that extends another class called NativeCurrency. The purpose of this class is to represent the native currency of the Avalanche blockchain, which is denoted by the symbol AVAX. 

The constructor of the Avalanche class takes in a single parameter called chainId, which is a number representing the ID of the Avalanche blockchain. The constructor then calls the constructor of the NativeCurrency class with the chainId parameter, as well as two other parameters: 18, which represents the number of decimal places for the currency, and 'AVAX', which represents the symbol for the currency. The last parameter, 'Avalanche', is a string representing the name of the currency.

The Avalanche class also defines a method called 'wrapped', which returns a Token object representing the wrapped version of the native currency. The wrapped version of the currency is represented by the WNATIVE constant, which is imported from another file. The 'wrapped' method first checks if the WNATIVE constant for the current chainId exists, and throws an error if it does not. Otherwise, it returns the Token object representing the wrapped currency.

The Avalanche class also defines a static method called 'onChain', which takes in a single parameter called chainId and returns an instance of the Avalanche class for the specified chainId. This method uses a private static property called '_cache' to store instances of the Avalanche class for each chainId. If an instance for the specified chainId already exists in the cache, it is returned. Otherwise, a new instance is created and added to the cache before being returned.

Finally, the Avalanche class defines an 'equals' method, which takes in a Currency object as a parameter and returns a boolean indicating whether the passed-in object is equal to the Avalanche object. The method checks if the passed-in object is a native currency and has the same chainId as the Avalanche object.

Overall, the Avalanche class provides a convenient way to represent the native currency of the Avalanche blockchain and provides methods for accessing the wrapped version of the currency and creating instances of the class for different chainIds. This class can be used in conjunction with other classes and functions in the larger project to perform various operations involving the AVAX currency on the Avalanche blockchain. 

Example usage:

```
import { Avalanche } from 'zoo'

const avax = Avalanche.onChain(43114) // create an instance of Avalanche for chainId 43114
const wrapped = avax.wrapped // get the wrapped version of the AVAX currency
const equals = avax.equals(wrapped) // check if the wrapped version of AVAX is equal to the native AVAX currency
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
   This code defines a class called Avalanche that extends NativeCurrency and provides functionality for working with the AVAX currency on the Avalanche blockchain. It also provides a way to get the wrapped version of AVAX and check if two currencies are equal.

2. What is the significance of the "chainId" parameter and how is it used?
   The "chainId" parameter is used to identify the blockchain network that the currency belongs to. It is used to initialize the NativeCurrency superclass and to retrieve the wrapped version of AVAX for the specified chainId.

3. What is the purpose of the "_cache" property and how does it work?
   The "_cache" property is a static object that stores instances of the Avalanche class for each chainId that has been requested. When the "onChain" method is called with a chainId, it checks if an instance for that chainId already exists in the cache and returns it if it does. If not, it creates a new instance, adds it to the cache, and returns it. This helps to avoid creating multiple instances of the same currency for the same chainId.
