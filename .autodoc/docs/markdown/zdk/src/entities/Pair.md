The `Pair` class is a core component of the Uniswap V2 protocol, which is a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. The `Pair` class represents a pair of tokens that can be traded against each other on the Uniswap V2 exchange. 

The `Pair` class has several methods that allow users to interact with the pair. The `getOutputAmount` method takes an input amount of one token and returns the corresponding output amount of the other token in the pair, based on the current reserves of the tokens in the pair. The `getInputAmount` method does the opposite, taking an output amount of one token and returning the corresponding input amount of the other token in the pair. These methods are used to calculate the price of a trade on the Uniswap V2 exchange.

The `getLiquidityMinted` method calculates the amount of liquidity tokens that should be minted when a user adds liquidity to the pair. The `getLiquidityValue` method calculates the value of a given amount of liquidity tokens in terms of one of the tokens in the pair. These methods are used to manage liquidity on the Uniswap V2 exchange.

The `Pair` class also has several getter methods that return information about the pair, such as the reserve amounts of each token, the current mid price of the pair in terms of each token, and the liquidity token associated with the pair.

Overall, the `Pair` class is a critical component of the Uniswap V2 protocol, providing the functionality needed to trade and manage liquidity for pairs of tokens on the exchange. 

Example usage:

```
import { Token, CurrencyAmount } from './path/to/Token'
import { Pair } from './path/to/Pair'

const tokenA = new Token(1, '0x123', 18, 'TOKENA', 'Token A')
const tokenB = new Token(1, '0x456', 18, 'TOKENB', 'Token B')
const pair = new Pair(
  CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(tokenA, '1000'),
  CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(tokenB, '2000')
)

const inputAmount = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(tokenA, '100')
const [outputAmount, newPair] = pair.getOutputAmount(inputAmount)
console.log(`Output amount: ${outputAmount.toExact()}`) // Output amount: 199.600798403193612774

const outputAmount2 = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(tokenB, '500')
const [inputAmount2, newPair2] = pair.getInputAmount(outputAmount2)
console.log(`Input amount: ${inputAmount2.toExact()}`) // Input amount: 251.256281407035175879

const totalSupply = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(pair.liquidityToken, '1000')
const tokenAmountA = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(tokenA, '500')
const tokenAmountB = CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(tokenB, '1000')
const liquidity = pair.getLiquidityMinted(totalSupply, tokenAmountA, tokenAmountB)
console.log(`Liquidity minted: ${liquidity.toExact()}`) // Liquidity minted: 499.500499500499500499

const liquidityValue = pair.getLiquidityValue(tokenA, totalSupply, liquidity)
console.log(`Liquidity value: ${liquidityValue.toExact()}`) // Liquidity value: 500
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Pair` class?
- The `Pair` class represents a pair of tokens in a Uniswap V2 exchange and provides methods for interacting with the pair, such as getting the current mid price, calculating output and input amounts, and getting liquidity information.

2. What are the parameters required to create a new instance of the `Pair` class?
- A new instance of the `Pair` class requires two `CurrencyAmount` objects representing the amounts of the two tokens in the pair.

3. What errors can be thrown by the `getOutputAmount` and `getInputAmount` methods?
- The `InsufficientReservesError` error can be thrown if one of the reserves is zero. The `InsufficientInputAmountError` error can be thrown if the output amount is zero.
