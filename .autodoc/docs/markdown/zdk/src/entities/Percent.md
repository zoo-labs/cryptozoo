The code above is a TypeScript module that exports a class called `Percent` and a function called `toPercent`. The `Percent` class extends the `Fraction` class and provides methods for performing arithmetic operations on percentages. The `toPercent` function takes a `Fraction` object as input and returns a `Percent` object.

The `Percent` class has a boolean property called `isPercent` that is set to `true`. This property is used to prevent a `Fraction` object from being interpreted as a `Percent` object. The `Percent` class also overrides the `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, and `divide` methods of the `Fraction` class to return `Percent` objects instead of `Fraction` objects.

In addition to the arithmetic methods, the `Percent` class provides two methods for formatting percentages: `toSignificant` and `toFixed`. Both methods multiply the `Percent` object by 100 and then call the corresponding method of the `Fraction` class. The `toSignificant` method formats the percentage to a specified number of significant digits, while the `toFixed` method formats the percentage to a specified number of decimal places.

The `toPercent` function takes a `Fraction` object as input and returns a `Percent` object. This function simply creates a new `Percent` object with the numerator and denominator of the input `Fraction` object.

This code is likely used in the larger project to perform arithmetic operations on percentages and to format percentages for display. For example, if the project involves financial calculations, the `Percent` class could be used to calculate interest rates or profit margins, and the `toSignificant` and `toFixed` methods could be used to format the results for display.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Fraction` class that is imported?
- The `Fraction` class is used to perform mathematical operations on fractions.

2. What is the purpose of the `Percent` class?
- The `Percent` class is a subclass of `Fraction` that is used to represent percentages and perform mathematical operations on them.

3. What is the purpose of the `toSignificant` and `toFixed` methods in the `Percent` class?
- The `toSignificant` and `toFixed` methods are used to convert a `Percent` object to a string representation with a specified number of significant digits or decimal places, respectively.
