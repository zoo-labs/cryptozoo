The code defines an abstract class called `AbstractCurrency` that represents any fungible financial instrument, including Ether, all ERC20 tokens, and other chain-native currencies. The class has several properties and methods that are used to define and manipulate currencies. 

The `isNative` property is a boolean that indicates whether the currency is native to the chain and must be wrapped (e.g. Ether). The `isToken` property is a boolean that indicates whether the currency is a token that is usable in Uniswap without wrapping. 

The `chainId` property is a number that represents the chain ID on which this currency resides. The `decimals` property is a number that represents the decimals used in representing currency amounts. The `symbol` property is a string that represents the symbol of the currency, i.e. a short textual non-unique identifier. The `name` property is a string that represents the name of the currency, i.e. a descriptive textual non-unique identifier. 

The class has a constructor that takes in the `chainId`, `decimals`, `symbol`, and `name` parameters and initializes the corresponding properties. The `equals` method is used to determine whether this currency is functionally equivalent to another currency. The `get wrapped` method returns the wrapped version of this currency that can be used with the Uniswap contracts. Currencies must implement this method to be used in Uniswap. The `serialize` method returns the token address, which is useful in cases where a dependency is needed to detect changes (e.g. useEffect).

This code is part of a larger project called `zoo` and can be used to define and manipulate currencies in the project. For example, a developer can create a new currency by extending the `AbstractCurrency` class and implementing the required methods. The `Currency` and `Token` classes are imported from other files in the project and are likely used in conjunction with the `AbstractCurrency` class to define and manipulate currencies. The `invariant` function is imported from the `tiny-invariant` library and is used to check that the `chainId` and `decimals` parameters are valid.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AbstractCurrency` class?
- The `AbstractCurrency` class is a base class for defining currencies, including native chain currencies and ERC20 tokens, and provides common properties and methods for all currencies.

2. What is the significance of the `isNative` and `isToken` properties?
- The `isNative` property indicates whether the currency is native to the chain and must be wrapped, while the `isToken` property indicates whether the currency is a token that can be used in Uniswap without wrapping.

3. What is the purpose of the `serialize` method?
- The `serialize` method returns the token address of the wrapped version of the currency, which can be useful for detecting changes in dependencies such as in the `useEffect` hook.
