This code defines an enum called `TradeType` with two possible values: `EXACT_INPUT` and `EXACT_OUTPUT`. 

In the context of the larger project, this enum is likely used to specify the type of trade being made in a decentralized exchange. A decentralized exchange allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without the need for a centralized authority. In order to make a trade, the user must specify whether they want to trade a specific amount of input currency for an exact amount of output currency (`EXACT_OUTPUT`), or if they want to receive a specific amount of output currency for an exact amount of input currency (`EXACT_INPUT`).

Here is an example of how this enum might be used in the larger project:

```
import { TradeType } from 'zoo';

const tradeType = TradeType.EXACT_OUTPUT;

if (tradeType === TradeType.EXACT_OUTPUT) {
  // execute trade with exact output
} else if (tradeType === TradeType.EXACT_INPUT) {
  // execute trade with exact input
}
```

In this example, we import the `TradeType` enum from the `zoo` module. We then set the `tradeType` variable to `TradeType.EXACT_OUTPUT`. We use an `if` statement to check the value of `tradeType` and execute the appropriate trade based on the value. If `tradeType` is `EXACT_OUTPUT`, we execute a trade with exact output. If `tradeType` is `EXACT_INPUT`, we execute a trade with exact input.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `TradeType` enum?** 
The `TradeType` enum is used to specify the type of trade being made, whether it is an exact input or exact output trade.

2. **Where is the `TradeType` enum being used in the `zoo` project?** 
Without further context, it is unclear where the `TradeType` enum is being used in the `zoo` project. It could potentially be used in multiple places, such as in functions that handle trades or in data structures that store trade information.

3. **Are there any other trade types that could be added to the `TradeType` enum in the future?** 
It is possible that additional trade types could be added to the `TradeType` enum in the future, but without further information about the project's requirements and goals, it is impossible to say for certain.
