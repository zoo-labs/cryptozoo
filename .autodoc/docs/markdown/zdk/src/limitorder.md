The code defines two classes, `LimitOrder` and `FillLimitOrder`, that are used to create and fill limit orders on a decentralized exchange. 

The `LimitOrder` class represents a limit order and has properties such as `maker`, `amountIn`, `amountOut`, `recipient`, `startTime`, `endTime`, `stopPrice`, `oracleAddress`, `oracleData`, `v`, `r`, and `s`. The `getLimitOrder` method is used to create a new `LimitOrder` instance from an object that contains the same properties. The `usePrice` method is used to update the `amountOut` property of the order based on a given price. The `signdOrderWithPrivatekey` and `signOrderWithProvider` methods are used to sign the order with a private key or a provider, respectively. The `getTypedData` and `getTypeHash` methods are used to get the typed data and type hash of the order, respectively. The `send` method is used to send the order to a server.

The `FillLimitOrder` class represents a fill limit order and has properties such as `order`, `path`, `amountExternal`, `amountToFill`, `limitOrderReceiver`, `to`, `tokenIn`, `tokenOut`, and `limitOrderReceiverData`. The `fillOrderOpen` and `fillOrder` methods are used to fill the order. The `fillOrderOpen` method is used to fill the order in an open state, while the `fillOrder` method is used to fill the order in a closed state. The `fillOrder` method takes a signer and an object that contains properties such as `debug`, `forceExecution`, `gasPrice`, `open`, and `nonce`. The `forceExecution` property is used to force the execution of the order if the gas estimation fails. The `open` property is used to fill the order in an open state. The `gasPrice` property is used to set the gas price of the transaction. The `nonce` property is used to set the nonce of the transaction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LimitOrder` class and its methods?
- The `LimitOrder` class represents a limit order and its properties, and its methods are used to sign and send the order to be executed on the blockchain.

2. What is the `FillLimitOrder` class used for?
- The `FillLimitOrder` class is used to fill a limit order by specifying the order, the path of tokens to trade, and the amount to fill.

3. What external dependencies does this code use?
- This code uses external dependencies such as `@ethersproject/bignumber`, `@ethersproject/contracts`, `@ethersproject/experimental`, `@ethersproject/abstract-signer`, `@ethersproject/transactions`, `@ethersproject/providers`, `@ethersproject/abi`, `isomorphic-unfetch`, and `@ethersproject/solidity`.
