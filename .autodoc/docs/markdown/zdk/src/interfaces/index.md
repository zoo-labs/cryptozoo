This code exports two modules, `AccrueInfo` and `Rebase`, from the `zoo` project. 

The `AccrueInfo` module likely handles the accumulation of information related to the animals in the zoo. This could include data such as their species, age, diet, and medical history. The module may provide methods for adding new information, updating existing information, and retrieving information for specific animals. 

Here is an example of how the `AccrueInfo` module may be used:

```
import { AccrueInfo } from 'zoo'

// create a new instance of AccrueInfo
const animalInfo = new AccrueInfo()

// add information for a new animal
animalInfo.addAnimal({
  name: 'Giraffe',
  species: 'Giraffa camelopardalis',
  age: 5,
  diet: 'Leaves and twigs',
  medicalHistory: []
})

// update the age of an existing animal
animalInfo.updateAnimal('Giraffe', { age: 6 })

// retrieve information for a specific animal
const giraffeInfo = animalInfo.getAnimalInfo('Giraffe')
console.log(giraffeInfo) // { name: 'Giraffe', species: 'Giraffa camelopardalis', age: 6, diet: 'Leaves and twigs', medicalHistory: [] }
```

The `Rebase` module likely handles the updating of the `zoo` project to a new base version. This could involve updating dependencies, refactoring code, and resolving conflicts. The module may provide methods for checking the current version, updating to a new version, and rolling back to a previous version if necessary. 

Here is an example of how the `Rebase` module may be used:

```
import { Rebase } from 'zoo'

// create a new instance of Rebase
const rebase = new Rebase()

// check the current version of the zoo project
const currentVersion = rebase.getCurrentVersion()
console.log(currentVersion) // '1.2.3'

// update the zoo project to a new version
rebase.updateToVersion('2.0.0')

// roll back to a previous version
rebase.rollbackToVersion('1.2.3')
```
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `AccrueInfo` and `Rebase` modules?** 
    - The code exports these two modules from the `zoo` project, but it's unclear what functionality they provide without further context or documentation.
2. **Are there any other modules being exported from this file or project?**
    - The code only shows two modules being exported, but there could be additional modules that are not shown in this file. It would be helpful to know if there are any other modules available for use.
3. **What is the relationship between the `AccrueInfo` and `Rebase` modules and the rest of the `zoo` project?**
    - It's unclear how these modules fit into the larger `zoo` project. Are they standalone modules or do they depend on other modules within the project? Understanding their relationship to the rest of the project would be helpful for developers using this code.
