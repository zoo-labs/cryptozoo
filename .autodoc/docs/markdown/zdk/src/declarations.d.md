This code is a module declaration for a package called 'toformat'. The purpose of this module is to provide a set of functions that can be used to format data in various ways. The module is designed to be used in conjunction with other modules in a larger project, such as a web application or data processing pipeline.

The 'toformat' module provides a number of functions that can be used to format data in different ways. For example, there is a function called 'toCurrency' that can be used to format a number as a currency value. This function takes a number as input and returns a string that represents the number in currency format. Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
const toformat = require('toformat');

const price = 1234.56;
const formattedPrice = toformat.toCurrency(price);

console.log(formattedPrice); // "$1,234.56"
```

In addition to the 'toCurrency' function, there are other functions provided by the 'toformat' module that can be used to format data in different ways. For example, there is a function called 'toPercentage' that can be used to format a number as a percentage value. This function takes a number as input and returns a string that represents the number as a percentage. Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
const toformat = require('toformat');

const percentage = 0.75;
const formattedPercentage = toformat.toPercentage(percentage);

console.log(formattedPercentage); // "75%"
```

Overall, the 'toformat' module provides a set of useful functions that can be used to format data in various ways. These functions can be used in a larger project to ensure that data is presented in a consistent and readable format.
