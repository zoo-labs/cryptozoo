The code in this file provides two functions, `toAmount` and `toShare`, that are used to convert between token amounts and their corresponding shares in the BentoBox protocol. The BentoBox protocol is a smart contract system that allows for efficient and secure management of multiple tokens in a single contract.

The `toAmount` function takes in a `token` object and a `shares` value, both of which are of type `BigNumber`. The `token` object contains information about the token, including its `bentoShare` and `bentoAmount` values. The `bentoShare` value represents the number of shares that correspond to one unit of the token, while the `bentoAmount` value represents the total amount of the token held in the BentoBox contract. The function then checks if the `bentoShare` value is greater than zero. If it is, the function calculates the corresponding token amount by multiplying the `shares` value by the `bentoAmount` value and dividing the result by the `bentoShare` value. If the `bentoShare` value is zero, the function returns a `Zero` value from the `@ethersproject/constants` library.

The `toShare` function is similar to `toAmount`, but it takes in a `token` object and an `amount` value instead. The function checks if the `bentoAmount` value is greater than zero. If it is, the function calculates the corresponding number of shares by multiplying the `amount` value by the `bentoShare` value and dividing the result by the `bentoAmount` value. If the `bentoAmount` value is zero, the function returns a `Zero` value from the `@ethersproject/constants` library.

These functions are useful for interacting with the BentoBox protocol in a more user-friendly way. For example, if a user wants to deposit a certain amount of a token into the BentoBox contract, they can use the `toShare` function to calculate the corresponding number of shares needed for the deposit. Similarly, if a user wants to withdraw a certain amount of a token from the BentoBox contract, they can use the `toAmount` function to calculate the corresponding amount of tokens they will receive. Overall, these functions help simplify the process of interacting with the BentoBox protocol and make it more accessible to developers and users.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BigNumber` and `Zero` imports from `@ethersproject`?
- `BigNumber` is used for performing arithmetic operations on large numbers, while `Zero` is a constant representing the value 0. 

2. What do the `toAmount` and `toShare` functions do?
- `toAmount` takes a `token` object and a `shares` value, and returns the corresponding amount of the token based on the ratio of `bentoAmount` to `bentoShare`. `toShare` does the opposite, taking a `token` object and an `amount` value, and returning the corresponding number of shares based on the same ratio.

3. What is the expected format of the `token` object passed to these functions?
- The `token` object should have `bentoAmount` and `bentoShare` properties, which are both `BigNumber` values representing the total amount and total shares of the token, respectively.
