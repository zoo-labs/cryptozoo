The code above is a function that computes the address of a pair of tokens in a decentralized exchange. It takes three parameters: the address of the factory contract that created the pair, and two Token objects representing the tokens in the pair. 

The function first sorts the tokens in a canonical order using the `sortsBefore` method of the Token class. This ensures that the same pair of tokens always has the same address, regardless of the order in which they are passed to the function. 

Next, the function uses the `getCreate2Address` method from the `@ethersproject/address` library to compute the address of the pair contract. This method takes three parameters: the address of the factory contract, a salt value, and the init code hash for the token chain. The salt value is computed by packing the addresses of the two tokens into a byte array and hashing it using the `keccak256` function from the `@ethersproject/solidity` library. The init code hash is a constant value defined in the `../constants` file for the token chain.

Overall, this function is a key component of the decentralized exchange infrastructure, as it allows users to interact with specific pairs of tokens in a standardized way. It can be used in conjunction with other functions and classes in the `zoo` project to build a fully functional decentralized exchange. 

Example usage:

```
import { computePairAddress } from 'zoo'

const factoryAddress = '0x1234567890abcdef'
const tokenA = new Token(1, '0x123', 18)
const tokenB = new Token(1, '0x456', 18)

const pairAddress = computePairAddress({ factoryAddress, tokenA, tokenB })

console.log(pairAddress) // '0x7890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef'
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code is used to compute the address of a pair of tokens in a decentralized exchange.

2. What are the inputs required for the `computePairAddress` function?
   The `computePairAddress` function requires three inputs: `factoryAddress` (string), `tokenA` (Token object), and `tokenB` (Token object).

3. What is the significance of the `INIT_CODE_HASH` constant?
   The `INIT_CODE_HASH` constant is used to ensure that the computed address is unique and corresponds to a specific version of the smart contract code. It is indexed by the `chainId` property of the `token0` object.
