The code in this file provides two functions that are used in the larger zoo project. The first function, `rebase`, takes in three parameters: `value`, `from`, and `to`, all of which are of type `BigNumber` from the `@ethersproject/bignumber` library. The purpose of this function is to calculate the new value of a number after a change in its base. The `value` parameter represents the original value, `from` represents the original base, and `to` represents the new base. The function returns the new value after the base change. If `from` is equal to zero, the function returns a `BigNumber` with a value of zero.

Here is an example of how the `rebase` function can be used:

```
import { BigNumber } from '@ethersproject/bignumber'
import { rebase } from './path/to/zoo'

const originalValue = BigNumber.from(100)
const originalBase = BigNumber.from(10)
const newBase = BigNumber.from(5)

const newValue = rebase(originalValue, originalBase, newBase)

console.log(newValue) // Output: 200
```

The second function, `toElastic`, takes in three parameters: `total`, `base`, and `roundUp`. `total` is an object that has two properties, `base` and `elastic`, both of which are of type `BigNumber`. The purpose of this function is to calculate the new value of a number after a change in its elasticity. The `base` parameter represents the original value, and `total` represents the new elasticity. The `roundUp` parameter is a boolean that determines whether the result should be rounded up or not. The function returns the new value after the elasticity change.

Here is an example of how the `toElastic` function can be used:

```
import { BigNumber } from '@ethersproject/bignumber'
import { toElastic } from './path/to/zoo'

const total = {
  base: BigNumber.from(10),
  elastic: BigNumber.from(20)
}
const base = BigNumber.from(100)
const roundUp = true

const newValue = toElastic(total, base, roundUp)

console.log(newValue) // Output: 200
```

Overall, these two functions are important for calculating new values after changes in base and elasticity, respectively. They are likely used in various parts of the larger zoo project to perform calculations and update values.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `rebase` function?
- The `rebase` function takes in a value, a "from" BigNumber, and a "to" BigNumber, and returns a new BigNumber that has been adjusted based on the ratio of "to" to "from". If "from" is falsy, it returns a BigNumber of 0.

2. What is the purpose of the `toElastic` function?
- The `toElastic` function takes in a `total` object with a `base` and an `elastic` property, a `base` BigNumber, and a boolean `roundUp` flag. It calculates a new BigNumber that represents the "elastic" value of the `total` object, based on the ratio of `elastic` to `base`. If `roundUp` is true and the calculated value is less than `base`, it adds 1 to the result.

3. What is the purpose of the `BigNumber` import from `@ethersproject/bignumber`?
- The `BigNumber` import is used to create and manipulate large numbers in JavaScript, which are often used in blockchain and cryptocurrency applications. It is specifically imported from the `@ethersproject/bignumber` library, which is a third-party library for working with big numbers in the context of the Ethereum blockchain.
