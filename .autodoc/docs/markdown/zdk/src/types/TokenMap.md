This code defines a type called `TokenMap` which is an object that maps a `chainId` number to a `Token` object. The `Token` object is imported from a file located in the `entities` directory. 

This type can be used in the larger project to keep track of different tokens on different chains. For example, if the project involves a decentralized exchange that supports multiple blockchains, the `TokenMap` can be used to store information about the tokens available on each chain. 

Here is an example of how this type can be used:

```
import { TokenMap } from 'zoo'

const tokens: TokenMap = {
  1: {
    name: 'Ethereum',
    symbol: 'ETH',
    address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
  },
  56: {
    name: 'Binance Coin',
    symbol: 'BNB',
    address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
  }
}

console.log(tokens[1].name) // Output: Ethereum
console.log(tokens[56].symbol) // Output: BNB
```

In this example, we create a `TokenMap` object called `tokens` that maps the `chainId` of Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain to their respective `Token` objects. We can then access the properties of each `Token` object by using the `chainId` as the key. 

Overall, this code provides a useful data structure for storing information about tokens on different blockchains in a decentralized application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Token` import from the `../entities` file?
   - The `Token` import is likely used within the `TokenMap` type to define the structure of the object.
2. What is the `TokenMap` type used for in the `zoo` project?
   - The `TokenMap` type is likely used to store a mapping of `Token` objects to their corresponding `chainId` values.
3. Are there any other files or modules that use the `TokenMap` type?
   - Without further context, it is unclear if any other files or modules use the `TokenMap` type.
