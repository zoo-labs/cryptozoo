This file contains two classes, `InsufficientReservesError` and `InsufficientInputAmountError`, that are used to indicate specific errors that can occur in the larger project. 

The `InsufficientReservesError` class is used to indicate that a pair (presumably a pair of assets in the project) has insufficient reserves to fulfill a desired output amount. This means that no matter how much input is sent, the desired output cannot be obtained. This error is thrown when this situation occurs. 

The `InsufficientInputAmountError` class is used to indicate that the input amount is too small to produce any amount of output. This means that the amount of input sent is less than the price of a single unit of output after fees. This error is thrown when this situation occurs. 

Both classes extend the built-in `Error` class and set a boolean property to indicate the specific error type. They also have a constructor that sets the name of the error to the name of the class and, if the `setPrototypeOf` method is available in the current environment, sets the prototype of the instance to the prototype of the class. 

These classes can be used throughout the larger project to handle these specific error cases. For example, if a user tries to make a trade but the reserves are insufficient, the `InsufficientReservesError` can be thrown to indicate this specific error case. 

Example usage:
```
try {
  // attempt to make a trade
} catch (error) {
  if (error.isInsufficientReservesError) {
    // handle insufficient reserves error
  } else if (error.isInsufficientInputAmountError) {
    // handle insufficient input amount error
  } else {
    // handle other error
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CAN_SET_PROTOTYPE` constant?
- The `CAN_SET_PROTOTYPE` constant is used to check if the `setPrototypeOf` method is available in the `Object` class.

2. What do the `InsufficientReservesError` and `InsufficientInputAmountError` classes represent?
- `InsufficientReservesError` represents a scenario where there are not enough reserves to obtain a desired output amount, while `InsufficientInputAmountError` represents a scenario where the input amount is too small to produce any amount of output.

3. Why is `Object.setPrototypeOf` used in the constructors of both error classes?
- `Object.setPrototypeOf` is used to set the prototype of the error instance to the prototype of the constructor function, which allows for proper inheritance and access to properties and methods defined in the parent class.
