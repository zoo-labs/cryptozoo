This code exports a configuration object that specifies how to build a JavaScript library called "MultiRouter" using TypeScript. The library is intended to be used as a router in a larger project. 

The `context` property sets the base directory for resolving entry points and loaders. In this case, it is set to the current directory. 

The `devtool` property specifies the type of source map to use for debugging. In this case, it is set to "inline-source-map", which means that the source map will be included in the generated JavaScript file. 

The `entry` property specifies the entry point for the library. In this case, it is set to "./tests/RouterExport.ts", which is a TypeScript file that exports the router implementation. 

The `mode` property specifies the build mode. In this case, it is set to "development", which means that the output will not be minified. 

The `module` property specifies the rules for loading modules. In this case, there is one rule that applies to files with a ".ts" extension. The rule uses the "ts-loader" to transpile TypeScript to JavaScript. 

The `output` property specifies the output file name and directory for the library. In this case, the output file name is "MultiRouter.js" and the output directory is "build". The `library` property specifies the name of the library that will be exported. 

The `resolve` property specifies the extensions that should be resolved when importing modules. In this case, it is set to ".ts", which means that TypeScript files can be imported without specifying the extension. 

Overall, this code sets up the configuration for building a TypeScript library that can be used as a router in a larger project. Here is an example of how this library might be used:

```typescript
import { Router } from 'MultiRouter';

const router = new Router();

router.addRoute('/home', () => {
  console.log('Navigated to home page');
});

router.navigate('/home');
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code exports a configuration object for a development environment for a project called zoo. It sets up a module with a single rule to use the ts-loader for TypeScript files, and outputs a bundled file called MultiRouter.js in a build directory.

2. What is the significance of the "devtool" property?
- The "devtool" property sets the type of source map that will be generated for debugging purposes. In this case, it is set to "inline-source-map", which means that the source map will be included in the bundled file itself.

3. What is the purpose of the "library" property in the "output" object?
- The "library" property sets the name of the exported library for the bundled file. In this case, it is set to "Router", which means that the bundled file can be imported as a library with the name "Router".
