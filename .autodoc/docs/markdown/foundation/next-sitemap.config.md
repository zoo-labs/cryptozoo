This code exports an object that serves as a configuration file for the `next-sitemap` package. The `next-sitemap` package is a tool that generates a sitemap for Next.js applications. A sitemap is a file that lists all the pages on a website to help search engines crawl and index them. 

The exported object has three properties: `siteUrl`, `generateRobotsTxt`, and `robotsTxtOptions`. 

The `siteUrl` property is a string that specifies the base URL of the website. This URL should not have an additional slash at the end. In the example code, the `siteUrl` is set to `'https://tsnext-tw.thcl.dev'`. 

The `generateRobotsTxt` property is a boolean that determines whether or not to generate a `robots.txt` file. A `robots.txt` file is a file that tells search engine crawlers which pages or sections of a website should not be crawled or indexed. In the example code, `generateRobotsTxt` is set to `true`, which means that a `robots.txt` file will be generated. 

The `robotsTxtOptions` property is an object that specifies the options for the `robots.txt` file. In the example code, the `policies` property is set to an array with one object that has two properties: `userAgent` and `allow`. The `userAgent` property specifies which user agent (search engine crawler) the policy applies to, and the `allow` property specifies which pages or sections of the website the crawler is allowed to access. In this case, the policy allows all crawlers to access all pages on the website. 

This configuration file can be used in a Next.js application by importing it into the `next-sitemap.js` file and passing it as an argument to the `withSitemap` function. For example:

```
const sitemapConfig = require('./zoo/sitemapConfig');

module.exports = withSitemap({
  sitemap: {
    ...sitemapConfig,
  },
});
```

This code imports the `sitemapConfig` object from the `zoo/sitemapConfig.js` file and spreads it into the `sitemap` property of the `withSitemap` function. This tells `next-sitemap` to use the configuration specified in the `sitemapConfig` object to generate the sitemap and `robots.txt` files.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `next-sitemap` package and how is it being used in this code?
   - The `next-sitemap` package is being used to generate a sitemap for the website. The `IConfig` type is defining the configuration options for the sitemap.
2. What is the significance of the `siteUrl` property and how should it be changed?
   - The `siteUrl` property is defining the base URL for the website. It should be changed to the appropriate URL for the website being developed.
3. What is the purpose of the `robotsTxtOptions` property and how is it being used?
   - The `robotsTxtOptions` property is defining the options for generating a `robots.txt` file. In this case, it is allowing all user agents to access all pages on the website.
