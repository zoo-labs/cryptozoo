This code defines the configuration for a Next.js project. Next.js is a React-based framework for building server-side rendered web applications. The configuration is stored in an object called `nextConfig` and is exported for use in other parts of the project.

The configuration includes several options. The first option is `eslint`, which specifies the directories to be linted by ESLint, a popular JavaScript linter. In this case, only the `src` directory will be linted.

The second option is `reactStrictMode`, which enables React's strict mode. This mode helps identify potential issues in the application's code and provides warnings to help developers fix them.

The third option is `swcMinify`, which enables minification of the project's JavaScript code using the SWC compiler. Minification reduces the size of the code, making it faster to load in the browser.

The fourth option is commented out, but it provides a way to whitelist domains for images used in the project. This can be useful for security purposes, as it prevents images from untrusted domains from being loaded.

The fifth option configures the webpack module bundler used by Next.js. It adds a rule to handle SVG files, which are converted to React components using the `@svgr/webpack` loader. This allows SVG files to be used as components in the application's code.

Overall, this configuration file sets up several important features for a Next.js project, including linting, strict mode, minification, and SVG handling. It can be customized further to meet the specific needs of the project. For example, the `images` option can be uncommented and modified to whitelist additional domains as needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code is a configuration file for a Next.js project called `zoo`. It sets various options for the project, including enabling ESLint, enabling React strict mode, and configuring webpack to handle SVG files using the `@svgr/webpack` loader.

2. What is the significance of the `swcMinify` option?
   
   The `swcMinify` option enables minification of the project's JavaScript code using the SWC compiler. This can result in smaller file sizes and faster load times for the project.

3. How can the domain whitelist for images be configured?
   
   The domain whitelist for images can be configured by uncommenting the `images` option and adding one or more domains to the `domains` array. This can be useful for allowing images from trusted sources to be loaded in the project.
