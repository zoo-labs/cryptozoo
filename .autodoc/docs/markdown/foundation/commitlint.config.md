This code exports an object that contains configuration options for the commitlint library. Commitlint is a tool that checks commit messages to ensure they follow a certain format. The configuration options in this file specify the rules that commitlint should use when checking commit messages.

The `extends` property specifies that this configuration file extends the `config-conventional` configuration provided by commitlint. This means that the rules defined in `config-conventional` will be applied, and any additional rules defined in this file will override or add to those rules.

The `rules` property is an object that contains the specific rules to be applied. The `type-enum` rule specifies that the `type` field in a commit message must be one of the values listed in the array. The values in the array correspond to different types of changes that can be made in a commit, such as `feat` for a new feature, `fix` for a bug fix, `docs` for documentation changes, and so on.

The `// TODO Add Scope Enum Here` comment indicates that there is a rule that is currently commented out, but could be added later. This rule would specify that the `scope` field in a commit message must be one of a list of predefined values.

Overall, this code ensures that commit messages in the project follow a consistent format, making it easier to understand the changes made in each commit. Here is an example of a valid commit message that would pass the rules defined in this file:

```
feat: Add new animal to zoo
```

And here is an example of an invalid commit message that would fail the `type-enum` rule:

```
bugfix: Fix typo in animal name
```

In summary, this code is an important part of the project's development process, as it helps maintain consistency and clarity in commit messages.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code exports an object that extends a conventional commit linting configuration and defines rules for commit message types.

2. What is the significance of the `type-enum` rule?
   The `type-enum` rule enforces that commit messages must have one of the specified types, such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, etc.

3. What is the purpose of the commented out `scope-enum` rule?
   The `scope-enum` rule is currently commented out, but it appears to be intended to enforce that commit messages must have a valid scope value.
