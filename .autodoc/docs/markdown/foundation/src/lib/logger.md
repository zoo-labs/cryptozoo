The code above is a logger function that is used to log information during development. It is designed to only log information when the `showLogger` constant is set to true. This function takes two parameters: `object` and `comment`. The `object` parameter is the object that needs to be logged, while the `comment` parameter is an optional string that can be used to provide additional information about the log.

The logger function uses the `console.log()` method to output the log information. The log information is formatted using a template literal that includes the `typeof window` check to ensure that the function works in both the browser and server environments. The log information includes the path name of the current page, the comment (if provided), and the object that needs to be logged.

This logger function is useful in the larger project because it allows developers to log information during development without cluttering the console with unnecessary logs. By setting the `showLogger` constant to true, developers can easily see the information they need to debug the application. Here is an example of how this logger function can be used in the larger project:

```
import logger from '@/utils/logger';

function myFunction() {
  const myObject = { name: 'John', age: 30 };
  logger(myObject, 'This is my object');
}
```

In the example above, the `myFunction()` function creates an object called `myObject` and passes it to the `logger()` function along with a comment. If the `showLogger` constant is set to true, the logger function will output the log information to the console. This information can be used to debug the application and identify any issues that may be present.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `showLogger` constant and where is it defined?
- `showLogger` is used to determine whether or not to log information and is likely defined in the `env` module. 

2. What is the significance of the `lg` snippet mentioned in the `comment` parameter?
- The `lg` snippet is likely a shorthand for a comment template used by the developer to quickly generate comments for logging purposes. 

3. What is the purpose of the `%c` and `color` parameters in the `console.log` statement?
- The `%c` parameter is used to apply CSS styles to the logged text, and the `color` parameter sets the color of the text to a specific shade of blue.
