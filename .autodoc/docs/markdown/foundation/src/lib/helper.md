The code in this file provides three functions that can be used in a larger project. The first function, `openGraph`, generates an Open Graph (OG) image for a website. The function takes in an object with four properties: `siteName`, `description`, `templateTitle`, and `logo`. The `siteName` and `description` properties are required, while the other two are optional. The function returns a URL that can be used to generate the OG image. 

Here is an example of how to use the `openGraph` function:

```
const ogUrl = openGraph({
  siteName: 'My Website',
  description: 'This is a description of my website',
  templateTitle: 'My Template',
  logo: 'https://example.com/logo.png'
});

// ogUrl will be a string containing the URL for the OG image
```

The second and third functions, `getFromLocalStorage` and `getFromSessionStorage`, respectively, retrieve a value from either local or session storage. Both functions take in a `key` parameter and return the value associated with that key in the storage. If the storage is not available (e.g. if `window` or `sessionStorage` is undefined), the functions return `null`.

Here is an example of how to use the `getFromLocalStorage` function:

```
const myValue = getFromLocalStorage('myKey');

// myValue will be either the value associated with 'myKey' in local storage or null
```

Overall, these functions can be used to add functionality to a larger project. The `openGraph` function can be used to generate OG images for a website, while the `getFromLocalStorage` and `getFromSessionStorage` functions can be used to retrieve values from storage.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `openGraph` function?
   - The `openGraph` function generates an Open Graph URL based on the provided parameters such as site name, description, logo, and template title.

2. What is the purpose of the `getFromLocalStorage` function?
   - The `getFromLocalStorage` function retrieves a value from the local storage of the browser based on the provided key.

3. What is the purpose of the `getFromSessionStorage` function?
   - The `getFromSessionStorage` function retrieves a value from the session storage of the browser based on the provided key.
