The `Detail` function in this code file is responsible for rendering a detailed view of a specific animal in the zoo. The function returns a JSX element that contains two main sections: a large section that is visible on larger screens and a smaller section that is visible on smaller screens. 

The larger section contains an image of the animal, along with some text and links to allow the user to volunteer, donate, or learn more about the animal. The image is displayed using the `Image` component from the Next.js framework, which allows for optimized image loading and resizing. The text is displayed using various `p` and `h1` elements, and the links are created using the `Link` component from Next.js.

The smaller section contains a smaller version of the same image, along with a link to learn more about the animal. This section is displayed using a different layout that is optimized for smaller screens.

Overall, this code file is an important part of the zoo project because it allows users to learn more about the animals in the zoo and take action to support them. It could be used in conjunction with other code files to create a larger website or application that provides information about the zoo and its animals. 

Here is an example of how this code file might be used in a larger project:

```jsx
import Detail from './Detail';

function AnimalPage({ animal }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{animal.name}</h1>
      <Detail />
    </div>
  );
}

export default AnimalPage;
```

In this example, the `AnimalPage` component is responsible for rendering a page that displays information about a specific animal. The `Detail` component is used to display a detailed view of the animal, which includes an image and links to allow the user to take action to support the animal. By using the `Detail` component in this way, the `AnimalPage` component can provide a consistent and informative experience for users who want to learn more about the animals in the zoo.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Detail` function?
- The `Detail` function is a React component that returns JSX code for rendering a page with information about the Red Wolf and options for volunteering, donating, and learning more.

2. What is the significance of the `max-md` class name used throughout the code?
- The `max-md` class name is used to apply styles that only take effect when the screen size is smaller than or equal to the maximum width specified for medium-sized devices.

3. How are the `Link` components used in this code?
- The `Link` components are used to create clickable links that navigate to different pages or sections within the same page. They are styled with CSS classes and contain SVG icons as well as text labels.
