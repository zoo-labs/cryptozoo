The `Footer` component is responsible for rendering the footer section of the website. It contains two sections, one for larger screens and one for smaller screens. The larger screen section contains five columns, each with a different set of links. The first column contains links to the Zoo Foundation's social media pages, including Twitter, Telegram, Instagram, Discord, Medium, and YouTube. The second column contains links to pages about the Zoo Foundation, including the About page, Get Involved page, Donation page, Volunteer page, and Initiatives page. The third column contains links to pages about different animals, including the Red Wolf, Nubian Giraffe, Amur Leopard, and Sumatran Elephant. The fourth column contains links to pages about other animals, including the Javan Rhino, Pygmy Hippo, and Siberian Tiger. The fifth column contains links to the Zoo Foundation's Terms of Use, the zoolabs.io website, and the foundation's email address.

The smaller screen section contains fewer links and is more condensed. It contains links to the Home page, About page, Get Involved page, Collect page, and Donation page. It also contains links to the Zoo Foundation's social media pages.

This component can be used in the larger project by importing it into other components and rendering it at the bottom of the page. For example, a `Layout` component could import the `Footer` component and render it after the main content of the page. This would ensure that the footer is consistent across all pages of the website.

Example usage:

```
import Footer from './Footer';

function Layout(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <main>{props.children}</main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

export default Layout;
```
## Questions:

3. What is the layout and content of the footer section?
