The `InvolvedContent` function in the `zoo` project is a React component that renders a section of content related to getting involved with the zoo. The component takes in several props, including `title`, `content1`, `content2`, `image`, `direction`, and `type`. 

The `title` prop is a string that represents the main heading of the section, while `content1` and `content2` are strings that represent the body content. The `image` prop is a string that represents the URL of an image to be displayed alongside the content. The `direction` prop is a string that determines the layout of the content and image, while the `type` prop is a string that determines which set of buttons to display.

The component returns a div that contains the content and image, with the layout determined by the `direction` prop. The content is styled with various classes that determine the font size, color, and spacing. The image is displayed using the `next/image` component, which optimizes the image for performance and responsiveness.

The buttons displayed at the bottom of the content are determined by the `type` prop. If `type` is equal to 2, then two buttons are displayed: one for donating and one for volunteering. If `type` is not equal to 2, then three buttons are displayed: one for volunteering, one for donating, and one for learning more. The buttons are styled with various classes that determine the font size, color, and spacing.

Overall, the `InvolvedContent` component is a reusable component that can be used to display content related to getting involved with the zoo. It provides flexibility in terms of layout and button options, and uses the `next/image` component for optimized image display. 

Example usage:

```
<InvolvedContent
  title="Get Involved"
  content1="Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Sed euismod, sapien vel bibendum bibendum, velit elit bibendum ipsum, vitae bibendum ipsum elit vel sapien."
  content2="Nulla facilisi. Sed euismod, sapien vel bibendum bibendum, velit elit bibendum ipsum, vitae bibendum ipsum elit vel sapien."
  image="/images/get-involved.jpg"
  direction="1"
  type="1"
/>
```
