The `IconLink` component is a reusable React component that renders a button-like link with an icon. It takes in several props, including `isDarkBg`, `variant`, `icon`, and `iconClassName`. 

The `isDarkBg` prop is a boolean that determines whether the background of the button should be dark or light. The `variant` prop is a string that determines the color scheme of the button. It can be one of five values: `primary`, `outline`, `ghost`, `light`, or `dark`. The `icon` prop is an icon component from the `react-icons` library that will be rendered inside the button. The `iconClassName` prop is a string that can be used to add additional classes to the icon.

The `IconLink` component uses the `UnstyledLink` component from the `@/components/links/UnstyledLink` module to render the link. It uses the `clsxm` utility function from the `@/lib/clsxm` module to generate the class names for the link based on the props passed to the `IconLink` component.

The `IconLink` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. Here's an example of how it might be used:

```
import IconLink from '@/components/IconLink';
import { FaGithub } from 'react-icons/fa';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <IconLink
      href='https://github.com/myusername/myrepo'
      target='_blank'
      rel='noopener noreferrer'
      variant='primary'
      icon={FaGithub}
      iconClassName='w-6 h-6'
    >
      View on GitHub
    </IconLink>
  );
}
```

This example uses the `IconLink` component to render a link to a GitHub repository. It sets the `href`, `target`, and `rel` props on the `UnstyledLink` component to make it open the link in a new tab. It sets the `variant` prop to `'primary'` to make the button blue. It sets the `icon` prop to the `FaGithub` component from the `react-icons/fa` module to render the GitHub icon inside the button. It sets the `iconClassName` prop to `'w-6 h-6'` to make the icon 6 pixels wide and 6 pixels tall. Finally, it sets the children of the `IconLink` component to `'View on GitHub'` to display the text inside the button.
