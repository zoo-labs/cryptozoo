The `ButtonLink` component is a reusable React component that renders a button as an anchor element with customizable styles. It is designed to be used as a link that looks like a button, and can be used in any React project that requires such a component. 

The component takes in several props that allow for customization of the button's appearance. These include `variant`, `size`, `isDarkBg`, `leftIcon`, `rightIcon`, `leftIconClassName`, and `rightIconClassName`. 

The `variant` prop determines the color scheme of the button and can be one of five values: `primary`, `outline`, `ghost`, `light`, or `dark`. The `size` prop determines the size of the button and can be one of two values: `sm` or `base`. The `isDarkBg` prop determines whether the button is on a dark background or not. The `leftIcon` and `rightIcon` props allow for icons to be added to the left or right of the button text, respectively. The `leftIconClassName` and `rightIconClassName` props allow for additional classes to be added to the icon elements.

The component uses the `UnstyledLink` component from the `@/components/links/UnstyledLink` module to render the anchor element. It also uses the `clsxm` function from the `@/lib/clsxm` module to generate the class names for the button element based on the props passed in.

The `ButtonLink` component is exported as the default export of the module, allowing it to be easily imported and used in other parts of the project. 

Example usage:

```
import ButtonLink from '@/components/ButtonLink';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ButtonLink variant="primary" size="sm" href="/my-page">
      Click me!
    </ButtonLink>
  );
}
```
