The code defines a React component called `TextButton` that renders a button element with customizable styling. The component accepts several props, including `variant`, which determines the color scheme of the button. The available variants are `'primary'` and `'basic'`. 

The component uses the `clsxm` library to conditionally apply CSS classes to the button element based on the `variant` prop and other props like `disabled` and `className`. The CSS classes define the appearance of the button, including its font weight, text color, and background color. 

The `TextButton` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, a component that needs to render a button with a specific color scheme could import `TextButton` and pass the desired `variant` prop. 

Here's an example of how `TextButton` could be used in another component:

```
import TextButton from '@/components/TextButton';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <TextButton variant="primary">Click me!</TextButton>
      <TextButton variant="basic">Cancel</TextButton>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `MyComponent` renders two `TextButton` components with different `variant` props. The first button has a primary color scheme, while the second button has a basic color scheme.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `clsxm` function being imported from `@/lib/clsxm`?
   - The smart developer might ask what the `clsxm` function does and how it is used in the code. The answer is that `clsxm` is a utility function used to concatenate class names together for use in the `className` attribute of the `button` element.

2. What are the possible values for the `variant` prop and how do they affect the appearance of the button?
   - The smart developer might ask what the `variant` prop does and what values it can take. The answer is that `variant` is an optional prop that can take either `'primary'` or `'basic'` as its value, and it affects the color and text styles of the button.

3. Why is the `buttonDisabled` prop being used instead of the `disabled` prop?
   - The smart developer might ask why the `buttonDisabled` prop is being used instead of the `disabled` prop, which is a standard prop for disabling form elements. The answer is that `buttonDisabled` is used to avoid a naming conflict with the `disabled` attribute of the `button` element, which is used to disable the button.
