The `CardList` function in the `zoo` project is responsible for rendering a list of trading cards on a webpage. The function imports the `Image` component from the `next/image` library, which is used to display the images of the trading cards. 

The function defines an array called `cardlist` that contains objects with the `img` property set to the file path of each trading card image. The function then returns a JSX element that contains a `div` with a black background color. Inside this `div`, there is another `div` with a grid layout that displays the trading cards in a 3-column layout. 

The `map` method is used to iterate over the `cardlist` array and render an `Image` component for each trading card. The `src` attribute of the `Image` component is set to the `img` property of each object in the `cardlist` array. The `width` and `height` attributes are set to 800 pixels, which is the size of the trading card images. 

This function can be used in the larger `zoo` project to display a collection of trading cards on a webpage. The `cardlist` array can be updated with new trading cards, and the `CardList` function will automatically render the updated list of cards. 

Example usage of the `CardList` function:

```
import CardList from './CardList';

function TradingCardsPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Trading Cards</h1>
      <CardList />
    </div>
  );
}

export default TradingCardsPage;
```

In this example, the `TradingCardsPage` component renders a heading and the `CardList` component to display a collection of trading cards.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a component called `CardList` that renders a grid of trading card images using the Next.js `Image` component.

2. Where are the trading card images sourced from?
   The trading card images are sourced from the `/images` directory, but it is unclear where this directory is located relative to the `zoo` project.

3. Why are there duplicate entries in the `cardlist` array?
   It is unclear why there are duplicate entries for the `img` property in the `cardlist` array. This may be intentional or a mistake that needs to be corrected.
