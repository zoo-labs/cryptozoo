The `Support` function in the `zoo` project returns a JSX element that renders a section of the project's website. The purpose of this section is to inform visitors about the project's mission to support endangered species through the sale of digital collectibles. 

The JSX element returned by the `Support` function contains a `div` element with a black background and padding. Inside this `div`, there is another `div` element with a flexbox layout and padding. The `flex` class is used to arrange the child elements of this `div` in a row on larger screens and in a column on smaller screens. 

The `h1` element inside the second `div` contains the main heading of the section, which is displayed in white text and has varying font sizes depending on the screen size. The `p` elements contain paragraphs of text that describe the project's mission and how it works. These paragraphs are also displayed in white text and have varying font sizes depending on the screen size. 

The `Support` function is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, if another component needs to display the `Support` section on a different page of the website, it can import the `Support` function and render it as a child element. 

Here is an example of how the `Support` function can be used in another component:

```
import Support from './Support';

function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo Project</h1>
      <Support />
    </div>
  );
}

export default HomePage;
```

In this example, the `HomePage` component imports the `Support` function from the `Support.js` module and renders it as a child element inside a `div` element. This will display the `Support` section below the main heading of the page.
