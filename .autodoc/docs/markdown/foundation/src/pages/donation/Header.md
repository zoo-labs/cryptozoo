The `Header` function in this code file is a React component that renders a donation header for the Zoo Labs Foundation website. The component imports the `useState` hook from React and the `Image` component from the `next/image` library. It also imports the `Switch` component from the `react-switch` library.

The `Header` function returns a JSX element that contains the donation header. The header is divided into two sections: the left section contains the donation form and the right section contains an image. The left section is further divided into four parts: a title, a heading, a paragraph, and a donation form.

The title is a short statement that reads "End the road to extinction". The heading is a call to action that reads "Donate to the Zoo Labs Foundation". The paragraph is a description of the foundation's mission and purpose. The donation form contains three elements: a switch, an input field, and a button.

The switch is a toggle button that allows the user to switch between a one-time donation and a monthly donation. The input field allows the user to enter the amount they wish to donate. The button is a call to action that reads "Donate Now".

The right section contains an image that is floated to the right. The image is a visual representation of the foundation's mission and purpose.

The `Header` function exports the component so that it can be used in other parts of the Zoo Labs Foundation website. For example, the component can be imported into the homepage of the website and rendered as a header at the top of the page.

Here is an example of how the `Header` component can be used in a React application:

```
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <p>Welcome to the Zoo Labs Foundation website!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Switch` component and how does it work?
   - The `Switch` component is used to toggle between monthly and one-time donations. It works by calling the `handleChange` function when it is toggled, which updates the `checked` state variable.
2. What is the purpose of the `Image` component and how is it positioned on the page?
   - The `Image` component is used to display an image of a donation header. It is positioned on the right side of the page using the `float-right` class.
3. What is the purpose of the `useState` hook and how is it used in this code?
   - The `useState` hook is used to create a state variable called `checked` and a function called `setChecked` to update it. It is used to keep track of whether the monthly donation switch is toggled on or off.
