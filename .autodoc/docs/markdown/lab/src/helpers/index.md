This code exports a default class called `Transactor` from a file located at `./Transactor`. The purpose of this class is to provide a way to interact with a database transactionally. 

In the larger project, this class can be used to ensure that database operations are performed atomically, meaning that either all of the operations succeed or none of them do. This is important for maintaining data integrity and consistency. 

Here is an example of how this class might be used:

```javascript
import { Transactor } from "zoo";

const transactor = new Transactor();

try {
  await transactor.beginTransaction();
  await transactor.insert("animals", { name: "lion", species: "Panthera leo" });
  await transactor.insert("animals", { name: "tiger", species: "Panthera tigris" });
  await transactor.commitTransaction();
} catch (error) {
  await transactor.rollbackTransaction();
  console.error(error);
}
```

In this example, we create a new instance of the `Transactor` class and use it to insert two new animal records into a hypothetical `animals` table. We wrap these insertions in a transaction by calling `beginTransaction()` before the first insert and `commitTransaction()` after the last insert. If any of the inserts fail, we catch the error and roll back the transaction by calling `rollbackTransaction()`. 

Overall, the `Transactor` class provides a convenient and safe way to perform database operations that need to be executed atomically.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Transactor` module?
   - The `Transactor` module is being exported as the default from this file, but without further context it is unclear what functionality it provides within the `zoo` project.

2. What other modules are being exported from the `zoo` project?
   - This code only shows the export of the `Transactor` module, so it is unclear if there are other modules being exported from the `zoo` project and what their purposes are.

3. What is the file path for the `Transactor` module?
   - The code shows that the `Transactor` module is being imported from a file located at `./Transactor`, but it is unclear where this file is located relative to the current file or the root directory of the `zoo` project.
