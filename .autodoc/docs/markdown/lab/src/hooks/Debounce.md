The `useDebounce` function is a custom React hook that allows for the debouncing of a value. Debouncing is a technique used to limit the number of times a function is called by delaying its execution until a certain amount of time has passed since the last time it was called. This is useful in scenarios where a function is called frequently, such as in response to user input, but the function's execution is resource-intensive and should be limited to prevent performance issues.

The `useDebounce` function takes two parameters: `value` and `delay`. `value` is the value that needs to be debounced, and `delay` is the amount of time in milliseconds that needs to pass before the debounced value is updated. The function returns the debounced value.

The function uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React. `useState` is used to create a state variable called `debouncedValue`, which is initialized with the `value` parameter. `useEffect` is used to set up a timer that updates the `debouncedValue` state variable after the specified `delay` has passed since the last update to the `value` parameter. The `useEffect` hook also returns a cleanup function that clears the timer when the component unmounts or when the `value` parameter changes.

This custom hook can be used in a variety of scenarios where debouncing is needed, such as in search bars or auto-complete fields. Here is an example of how to use the `useDebounce` hook in a search bar component:

```
import React, { useState } from "react";
import useDebounce from "./useDebounce";

function SearchBar() {
  const [searchTerm, setSearchTerm] = useState("");
  const debouncedSearchTerm = useDebounce(searchTerm, 500);

  function handleSearch(event) {
    setSearchTerm(event.target.value);
  }

  // Perform search using debounced search term
  // ...

  return (
    <input type="text" value={searchTerm} onChange={handleSearch} />
  );
}
```

In this example, the `searchTerm` state variable is updated on every change to the search bar input. However, the actual search is performed using the `debouncedSearchTerm` variable, which is updated only after 500 milliseconds have passed since the last update to `searchTerm`. This prevents the search function from being called too frequently and improves performance.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a custom React hook called `useDebounce` that returns a debounced value of the input `value` after a specified `delay`.

2. What are the parameters of the `useDebounce` function?
   The `useDebounce` function takes two parameters: `value` (the input value to be debounced) and `delay` (the time in milliseconds to wait before returning the debounced value).

3. How does the `useDebounce` hook work?
   The `useDebounce` hook uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React to maintain the current `debouncedValue` state and update it after the specified `delay`. It returns the `debouncedValue` after each update.
