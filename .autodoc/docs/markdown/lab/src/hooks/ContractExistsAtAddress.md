## Code Explanation: `useContractExistsAtAddress`

The `useContractExistsAtAddress` function is a custom React hook that checks whether a smart contract exists on the blockchain. It takes two parameters: `provider` and `contractAddress`. `provider` is an object that represents the Ethereum provider (e.g. `localProvider`, `mainnetProvider`, etc.) and `contractAddress` is the address of the smart contract that we want to check.

The function uses the `useState` hook to create a state variable called `contractIsDeployed` and initializes it to `false`. This variable will be used to store the result of the contract existence check.

The function also uses the `useEffect` hook to perform the contract existence check. The `useEffect` hook is called whenever the `provider` or `contractAddress` parameters change. Inside the hook, the function first checks if the `contractAddress` is a valid Ethereum address using the `isAddress` function from the `ethers` library. If the address is invalid, the function returns `false`.

If the address is valid, the function uses the `getCode` method of the `provider` object to retrieve the bytecode stored at the `contractAddress`. If the bytecode is not equal to `0x0`, then a contract exists at that address and the `contractIsDeployed` state variable is set to `true`.

Finally, the function returns the `contractIsDeployed` state variable.

## How to Use

To use the `useContractExistsAtAddress` hook, you can import it from the `zoo` module and call it in your React component. Here's an example:

```javascript
import useContractExistsAtAddress from 'zoo';

function MyComponent({ provider, contractAddress }) {
  const contractIsDeployed = useContractExistsAtAddress(provider, contractAddress);

  // Use the contractIsDeployed variable to conditionally render content
  return (
    <div>
      {contractIsDeployed ? <p>Contract is deployed!</p> : <p>Contract is not deployed.</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, we pass in the `provider` and `contractAddress` variables as props to the `MyComponent` function. We then call the `useContractExistsAtAddress` hook with these variables to get the `contractIsDeployed` result. We can then use this result to conditionally render content based on whether the contract exists or not.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ethers` and `react` imports?
- The `ethers` import is used to access the `getCode` function to check if a contract exists at a given address, while the `react` import is used to define a custom React hook.
    
2. How does the `useContractExistsAtAddress` function determine if a contract is deployed?
- The function checks the bytecode stored at the provided contract address using the `getCode` function from the `provider` object. If the bytecode is not equal to "0x0", then a contract is deployed at that address.
    
3. Can this function be used to check for contract existence on different blockchain networks?
- Yes, the function can be used to check for contract existence on different blockchain networks by changing the `provider` object passed as an argument to the function. For example, passing a `mainnetProvider` object would check for contract existence on the Ethereum mainnet.
