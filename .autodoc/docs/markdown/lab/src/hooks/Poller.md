The code above is a custom React hook called `usePoller` that allows a function to be called regularly at specified time intervals. This hook takes in three parameters: `fn`, `delay`, and `extraWatch`. 

The `fn` parameter is the function that will be called at each interval. The `delay` parameter is the time interval in milliseconds between each call of the function. The `extraWatch` parameter is an optional parameter that can be used to trigger the function to run again if it changes.

The hook uses the `useEffect` and `useRef` hooks from React. The `useRef` hook is used to store the latest version of the `fn` parameter. The `useEffect` hook is used to update the stored `fn` parameter whenever it changes. 

The hook then sets up an interval using the `setInterval` function. The `setInterval` function takes in the `tick` function and the `delay` parameter. The `tick` function simply calls the stored `fn` parameter. The `useEffect` hook also returns a cleanup function that clears the interval using the `clearInterval` function.

Finally, the hook runs the `fn` function at the start using another `useEffect` hook. This hook is triggered whenever the `extraWatch` parameter changes.

This hook can be used in a larger project to regularly call a function, such as updating data from an API or refreshing a component. Here is an example of how to use this hook:

```
import React, { useState } from "react";
import usePoller from "./usePoller";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  usePoller(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, 1000);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this example, the `usePoller` hook is used to update the `count` state variable every second. The `setCount` function is called inside the `usePoller` hook to update the state. The updated `count` value is then displayed in the component.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
   This code exports a custom React hook called `usePoller` that takes in a function, a delay time, and an extra watch value as arguments. It sets up an interval to call the function regularly at the specified delay time, and also runs the function at the start and whenever the extra watch value changes.

2. What is the purpose of the `useRef` hook in this code?
   The `useRef` hook is used to create a mutable reference to the latest version of the function passed in as an argument to `usePoller`. This reference is then used in the interval setup to ensure that the latest version of the function is always called.

3. Why is there an `eslint-disable-next-line` comment in this code?
   The `eslint-disable-next-line` comment is used to disable the eslint rule that requires a `return` statement in the second `useEffect` hook. This is because the `return` statement is conditionally executed based on the value of `delay`, and eslint cannot determine this at compile time.
