The `Balance` component is responsible for displaying the balance of a given Ethereum address in both ether and dollars. It is a React component that uses the `useState` hook to manage the display mode (ether or dollar) and the `useBalance` hook to fetch the balance of the given address.

To use the `Balance` component, you can pass in the following props:

- `address`: the Ethereum address to fetch the balance for
- `provider`: the Ethereum provider to use (e.g. `mainnetProvider` or `localProvider`)
- `balance`: if you already have the balance as a BigNumber, you can pass it in directly
- `price`: the price of ether in dollars, used to convert the balance to dollars

Here's an example of how to use the `Balance` component:

```jsx
<Balance
  address="0x123abc..."
  provider={mainnetProvider}
  price={2000}
/>
```

This will display the balance of the address `0x123abc...` in both ether and dollars, using the `mainnetProvider` and assuming that ether is worth $2000.

The `Balance` component first checks if the balance is already provided as a prop (`props.balance` or `props.value`). If it is, it uses that balance instead of fetching it from the blockchain. Otherwise, it uses the `useBalance` hook to fetch the balance from the blockchain using the provided `provider`.

Once it has the balance, it converts it to ether using the `utils.formatEther` function from the `ethers` library. It then converts the ether balance to a float and rounds it to two decimal places using `parseFloat` and `toFixed`. If a `price` prop is provided and the display mode is set to dollars, it multiplies the ether balance by the price to get the dollar value.

Finally, the `Balance` component returns a `span` element that displays the balance and allows the user to toggle between ether and dollar mode by clicking on it. The style of the `span` element can be customized using the `size` prop.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useBalance` hook imported from "../hooks"?
- The `useBalance` hook is used to retrieve the balance of a given address from the blockchain.

2. What are the different ways to provide balance information to the `Balance` component?
- The `Balance` component can receive balance information either through the `address` and `provider` props or through the `balance` and `value` props.

3. How does the `Balance` component handle displaying the balance in dollars?
- The `Balance` component uses the `price` prop to convert the ether balance to dollars, and the `dollarMode` state variable to toggle between displaying the balance in ether or dollars when the component is clicked.
