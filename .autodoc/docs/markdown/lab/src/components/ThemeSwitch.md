This code implements a theme switcher component for a React-based project called zoo. The component allows users to switch between light and dark themes for the application. 

The code imports the Switch component from the antd library, which is a UI component library for React. It also imports the useEffect and useState hooks from React, and the useThemeSwitcher hook from the react-css-theme-switcher library. 

The ThemeSwitcher function is the default export of this module. It defines a state variable called isDarkMode, which is initially set based on the value of the "theme" key in the browser's local storage. If the "theme" key is not set or its value is "light", isDarkMode is set to false, otherwise it is set to true. 

The useThemeSwitcher hook is used to get the current theme, the theme switcher function, the status of the theme switcher, and the available themes. The current theme is used to set the "theme" key in the local storage whenever it changes. 

The toggleTheme function is called whenever the user toggles the Switch component. It updates the isDarkMode state variable and calls the switcher function with the appropriate theme (either "dark" or "light") based on the new value of isDarkMode. 

The component returns a div element that contains a span element and the Switch component. The span element displays either a sun or a moon emoji based on the current theme. The Switch component is checked if isDarkMode is true and calls the toggleTheme function whenever it is toggled. 

The commented out code block is used to avoid a flicker when the theme is changed. It is not currently being used in the component. 

Overall, this code provides a simple and customizable way for users to switch between light and dark themes in the zoo project. It can be easily integrated into other components and pages of the project by importing and rendering the ThemeSwitcher component. 

Example usage:

```
import ThemeSwitcher from "./ThemeSwitcher";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo!</h1>
      <ThemeSwitcher />
      {/* other components and pages */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions:

   - The `Switch` component is being imported from the `antd` library.
   
2. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook?
   - The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `localStorage` value for the current theme whenever it changes.

3. Why is there a commented out section of code?
   - The commented out code is used to avoid a flicker when the theme is changed, but it is not currently being used in the code.
