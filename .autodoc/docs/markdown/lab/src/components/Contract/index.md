The `Contract` component is a React component that displays information about a smart contract. It takes in several props, including `customContract`, `account`, `gasPrice`, `signer`, `provider`, `name`, `show`, `price`, `blockExplorer`, and `chainId`. 

The component first uses the `useContractLoader` hook to load all contracts available on the specified `provider` and `chainId`. If a `customContract` is provided, it uses that instead. It then checks if the contract is deployed at the specified address using the `useContractExistsAtAddress` hook.

The component then filters the contract's functions to only display those that are of type "function" and are not excluded by the `show` prop. If a function is queryable (i.e. has no inputs), it displays the return value using the `DisplayVariable` component. If a function has inputs, it displays a form using the `FunctionForm` component to allow users to provide these inputs.

Finally, the component renders a `Card` from the `antd` library that displays the contract's name, address, and account information. If the contract is deployed, it displays the contract functions. Otherwise, it displays a loading message that instructs the user to run `yarn run chain` and `yarn run deploy` to deploy the contract.

This component can be used to display information about any smart contract in a React application. For example, it could be used in a decentralized application to display information about a user's deployed smart contracts or to allow users to interact with a specific smart contract. 

Example usage:

```
<Contract
  provider={provider}
  name="MyContract"
  show={["myFunction"]}
  account={account}
  gasPrice={gasPrice}
  signer={signer}
  price={price}
  blockExplorer={blockExplorer}
  chainId={chainId}
/>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Contract` component?
- The `Contract` component is used to display information about a smart contract, including its functions and address.

2. What is the `noContractDisplay` variable used for?
- The `noContractDisplay` variable is used to display a message when the contract has not been deployed yet.

3. What is the purpose of the `isQueryable` function?
- The `isQueryable` function is used to determine if a contract function is queryable, meaning it has no inputs and is either a "view" or "pure" function.
