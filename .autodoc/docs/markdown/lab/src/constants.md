This code defines a set of constants and objects related to various blockchain networks. The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for storing network information that can be used throughout the larger project. 

The code defines several constants, including `INFURA_ID`, `ETHERSCAN_KEY`, and `BLOCKNATIVE_DAPPID`, which are API keys for various blockchain services. It also defines an object called `NETWORKS`, which contains information about various blockchain networks, including their name, color, chain ID, RPC URL, block explorer URL, and faucet URL. 

The `NETWORK` function takes a `chainId` parameter and returns the corresponding network object from the `NETWORKS` object. This function can be used to retrieve network information based on the chain ID, which is a unique identifier for each blockchain network. 

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to store and access network information for various blockchain networks. It can be used throughout the larger project to interact with different networks and services. 

Example usage:

```
import { NETWORK, NETWORKS } from 'zoo';

const network = NETWORK(56); // returns the mainnet network object
console.log(network.name); // logs "mainnet"

const networks = Object.values(NETWORKS); // returns an array of all network objects
console.log(networks.length); // logs the number of networks defined in the object
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file defines constants and objects related to various blockchain networks, including their names, chain IDs, RPC URLs, block explorers, and gas prices.

2. What is the significance of the `INFURA_ID`, `ETHERSCAN_KEY`, and `BLOCKNATIVE_DAPPID` constants?
- `INFURA_ID` is a unique identifier used to access the Infura API for Ethereum nodes. `ETHERSCAN_KEY` is an API key used to access the Etherscan API for blockchain data. `BLOCKNATIVE_DAPPID` is an ID used to integrate with the Blocknative Notify.js library for transaction notifications.

3. How can a developer use the `NETWORK` function?
- The `NETWORK` function takes a `chainId` parameter and returns an object containing information about the corresponding blockchain network, such as its name, color, and RPC URL. This can be useful for dynamically selecting network-specific settings and endpoints in a decentralized application.
