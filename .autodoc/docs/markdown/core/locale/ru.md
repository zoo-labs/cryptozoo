This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update. By storing all the text in one place, it is easier to ensure consistency in the language used throughout the application. 

For example, the strings "Add Liquidity" and "Remove Liquidity" are likely used as labels for buttons that allow the user to add or remove liquidity from a pool. Similarly, the string "Confirm Swap" is likely used as the label for a button that confirms a token swap transaction. 

Developers working on the zoo project can use these string literals in their code to display text to the user. For example, if a developer wants to display the label "Add Liquidity" on a button, they can reference the corresponding string literal in this file. 

Overall, this code is an important part of the zoo project's user interface, providing a centralized location for all the text used in the application.
