This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update the text as needed. By keeping all of the text in one place, it also ensures consistency in the language and terminology used throughout the project.

For example, the strings "Add Liquidity" and "Remove Liquidity" suggest that this project involves some sort of liquidity pool functionality. The string "Stake SUSHI for xSUSHI and deposit into BentoBox in one click" suggests that there may be some sort of yield farming or staking functionality as well.

Developers working on the zoo project can use these string literals in their code to display text to the user. For example, if a developer wanted to display a button labeled "Add Liquidity", they could use the string literal "Add Liquidity" from this code instead of hard-coding the text into their code. This makes it easier to update the text in the future if needed.

Overall, this code serves as a useful tool for managing the text used in the user interface of the zoo project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file contains a list of strings that are likely used for user interface elements in the zoo project.

2. What is the significance of the phrases "liquidity providers" and "xSUSHI holders" in some of the strings?
- These phrases suggest that the zoo project involves some kind of liquidity provision and incentivization system, where users can earn rewards for providing liquidity or holding xSUSHI tokens.

3. What is the purpose of the "Expert Mode" toggle and what are the potential risks associated with using it?
