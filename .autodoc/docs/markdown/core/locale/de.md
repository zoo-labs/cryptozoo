This code appears to be a collection of string literals used for user interface elements in the zoo project. These strings include various labels, buttons, and messages that are displayed to the user. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for all of the text used in the user interface, making it easier to manage and update. By storing all of the text in one place, it is also easier to ensure consistency in the language and terminology used throughout the application.

For example, the strings "Add Liquidity" and "Remove Liquidity" are likely used as labels for buttons that allow users to add or remove liquidity from a pool. Similarly, the string "Confirm Swap" is likely used as the label for a button that confirms a user's intention to execute a token swap.

The code also includes some informational messages, such as "A portion of each trade (0.25%) goes to liquidity providers as a protocol incentive." These messages are likely displayed to the user in order to provide context and transparency about the actions they are taking within the application.

Overall, this code is an important part of the zoo project's user interface, as it provides the text that is displayed to the user. By centralizing this text, the code makes it easier to manage and update the user interface, and helps ensure consistency in the language and terminology used throughout the application.
