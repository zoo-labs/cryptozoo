This code is responsible for exporting a default object that maps different ChainIds to a specific JSON file containing IPFS upload information. The `ChainId` object is imported from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, which is likely a library specific to the larger zoo project. 

The purpose of this code is to provide a way for the zoo project to easily access IPFS upload information for different ChainIds. The `localhostUploads` variable is imported from a separate file located at `../ipfs/localhost.json`, which likely contains the actual IPFS upload information. 

The exported object uses the `ChainId` object as keys and the `localhostUploads` variable as values. This means that when the zoo project needs to access IPFS upload information for a specific ChainId, it can simply import this object and access the corresponding value. 

For example, if the zoo project needs to access IPFS upload information for the `MAINNET` ChainId, it can import this object and access the `localhostUploads` value for the `MAINNET` key like so:

```
import ipfsUploads from './path/to/this/file'

const mainnetUploads = ipfsUploads[ChainId.MAINNET]
```

Overall, this code provides a simple and organized way for the zoo project to access IPFS upload information for different ChainIds.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChainId` import from `@zoolabs/zdk`?
   - The `ChainId` import is likely used to specify different chains for the `localhostUploads` object based on the current chain ID.

2. What is the `localhost.json` file and where is it located?
   - The `localhost.json` file is likely a configuration file containing information about the local IPFS node. Its location is relative to the current file's location in the `../ipfs/` directory.

3. Why is the `localhostUploads` object assigned to multiple chain IDs?
   - The `localhostUploads` object is likely used for testing purposes and is assigned to multiple chain IDs to ensure compatibility across different chains during development and testing.
