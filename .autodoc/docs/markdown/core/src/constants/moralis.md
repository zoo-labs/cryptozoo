The code defines a configuration object for the Moralis backend service, which is used in the larger zoo project. The configuration object contains two properties: `applicationID` and `serverURL`. The `applicationID` property is an object that maps different chain IDs to their respective application IDs. The `serverURL` property is an object that maps different chain IDs to their respective server URLs.

The `moralisConfig` function takes a `chainId` parameter and returns an object with the `applicationID` and `serverURL` properties for the specified chain ID. This function is used to retrieve the Moralis configuration for a specific chain ID, which is then used to connect to the Moralis backend service.

For example, if the `chainId` is `97`, the `moralisConfig` function will return an object with the `applicationID` and `serverURL` properties for the `97` chain ID. This object can then be used to connect to the Moralis backend service for the `97` chain.

Here is an example usage of the `moralisConfig` function:

```
import moralisConfig from 'zoo';

const chainId = 97;
const config = moralisConfig(chainId);

// Use the config object to connect to the Moralis backend service
Moralis.initialize(config.applicationID);
Moralis.serverURL = config.serverURL;
```

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to manage the Moralis configuration for different chain IDs in the zoo project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a configuration object with application IDs and server URLs for different chain IDs, and exports a function that returns the configuration for a given chain ID.

2. What are the possible values for `chainId` parameter in the `moralisConfig` function?
   - The possible values for `chainId` parameter are 1337, 97, and 56, which correspond to different blockchain networks.

3. Why are some lines of code commented out?
   - Some lines of code are commented out to indicate that they are not currently being used, but may be used in the future or in a different context.
