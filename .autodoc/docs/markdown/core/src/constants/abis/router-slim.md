This code defines two functions that can be used to swap tokens on a decentralized exchange. The first function, `swapExactETHForTokens`, allows the user to swap a specified amount of Ether for a specified amount of a different token. The function takes in four parameters: `amountOutMin`, which is the minimum amount of the token the user wants to receive; `path`, which is an array of addresses representing the path of tokens to trade, starting with Ether and ending with the desired token; `to`, which is the address that will receive the traded tokens; and `deadline`, which is the timestamp by which the transaction must be included in a block. The function is marked as `payable`, meaning that the user must send Ether along with the transaction in order to execute the swap.

The second function, `swapExactTokensForTokens`, allows the user to swap a specified amount of one token for a specified amount of another token. The function takes in five parameters: `amountIn`, which is the amount of the input token to trade; `amountOutMin`, which is the minimum amount of the output token the user wants to receive; `path`, which is an array of addresses representing the path of tokens to trade, starting with the input token and ending with the output token; `to`, which is the address that will receive the traded tokens; and `deadline`, which is the timestamp by which the transaction must be included in a block. The function is marked as `nonpayable`, meaning that the user does not need to send any Ether along with the transaction in order to execute the swap.

These functions are likely part of a larger project that involves interacting with a decentralized exchange, such as Uniswap or SushiSwap. They could be used by developers building applications that allow users to easily swap tokens without having to manually go through the exchange interface. For example, a decentralized finance (DeFi) application could use these functions to allow users to swap between different tokens within the app. Here is an example of how the `swapExactETHForTokens` function could be called:

```
const { ethers } = require('ethers');

const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider();
const signer = provider.getSigner();

const contractAddress = '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890';
const contractABI = [
  {
    "inputs": [
      { "internalType": "uint256", "name": "amountOutMin", "type": "uint256" },
      { "internalType": "address[]", "name": "path", "type": "address[]" },
      { "internalType": "address", "name": "to", "type": "address" },
      { "internalType": "uint256", "name": "deadline", "type": "uint256" }
    ],
    "name": "swapExactETHForTokens",
    "outputs": [{ "internalType": "uint256[]", "name": "amounts", "type": "uint256[]" }],
    "stateMutability": "payable",
    "type": "function"
  }
];

const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, signer);

const amountOutMin = ethers.utils.parseUnits('100', 'ether');
const path = ['0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2', '0x6b175474e89094c44da98b954eedeac495271d0f'];
const to = '0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890';
const deadline = Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 60 * 10; // 10 minutes from now

const tx = await contract.swapExactETHForTokens(amountOutMin, path, to, deadline, { value: ethers.utils.parseUnits('1', 'ether') });
await tx.wait();
```

This code uses the `ethers` library to interact with the contract at `contractAddress` using the `contractABI`. It then calls the `swapExactETHForTokens` function with the specified parameters, including sending 1 Ether along with the transaction. The function returns an array of `amounts`, which represents the actual amounts of tokens received in the trade. The code waits for the transaction to be confirmed on the blockchain before continuing.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines two functions for swapping tokens on a blockchain network.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `swapExactETHForTokens` function?
   - The inputs are `amountOutMin` (minimum amount of output tokens), `path` (array of token addresses), `to` (recipient address), and `deadline` (timestamp). The output is an array of `amounts` of output tokens.

3. What is the difference in `stateMutability` between the two functions?
   - The `swapExactETHForTokens` function is `payable`, meaning it can receive Ether along with its function call. The `swapExactTokensForTokens` function is `nonpayable`, meaning it cannot receive Ether.
