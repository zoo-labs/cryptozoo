The code provided is a Solidity smart contract for a staking pool that allows users to stake a specific token and earn rewards in another token. The contract is part of a larger project called "zoo" and is designed to be used in a decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem.

The constructor function takes in several parameters, including the staking token, reward token, reward manager, and two different MasterChef contracts. The chefPid parameter is used to identify the specific pool in the MasterChef contract that this staking pool is associated with.

The contract emits several events, including RewardAdded, RewardPaid, Staked, and Withdrawn, which are used to track rewards and staking activity.

The contract includes several functions for interacting with the staking pool. The addExtraReward function allows the reward manager to add additional rewards to the pool. The balanceOf function returns the balance of the staking token for a specific user. The earned function returns the amount of rewards earned by a specific user. The getReward function allows a user to claim their rewards. The stake function allows a user to stake a specific amount of the staking token. The withdraw function allows a user to withdraw their staked tokens and claim their rewards.

The contract also includes functions for interacting with the associated MasterChef contracts. The onSushiReward function is called by the SushiSwap MasterChef contract when rewards are distributed, and it updates the user's balance in the staking pool. The pendingTokens function returns the pending rewards for a specific user in both the staking token and reward token.

Overall, this contract provides a way for users to earn rewards by staking a specific token and is designed to be used in a larger DeFi ecosystem.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code appears to be a smart contract for a staking and reward system, likely for a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform. It allows users to stake a certain token and receive rewards in another token, with the rewards being distributed based on a set rate and duration.

2. What external contracts or systems does this code interact with?
- This code interacts with several external contracts and systems, including the staking token, reward token, reward manager, SushiSwap MasterChef contract, and Convex Finance MasterChef contract. It also appears to have functions for adding and clearing extra rewards.

3. What events and functions are available for developers to use in this code?
- Developers can use several events and functions in this code, including events for when rewards are added or paid out, and functions for staking, withdrawing, and claiming rewards. There are also functions for getting information about the current rewards and reward rate, as well as interacting with the external contracts and systems mentioned above.
