This code defines two related data structures used in the larger zoo project. The first is an enum called `ConnectorNames` which lists the names of different types of connectors that can be used to interact with the zoo platform. These connectors include `Injected`, which refers to a browser extension like MetaMask, `WalletConnect`, which is a mobile wallet integration, and `BSC`, which is a reference to the Binance Smart Chain. 

The second data structure is an object called `NETWORK_SYMBOL`. This object maps different `ChainId` values to their corresponding network symbols. `ChainId` is an enum defined in the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, which is imported at the top of the file. The `NETWORK_SYMBOL` object is defined using a TypeScript feature called an index signature, which allows for dynamic keys to be defined on an object. In this case, the keys are `ChainId` values and the values are strings representing the network symbols. 

This code is likely used throughout the larger zoo project to provide a centralized way of referring to different types of connectors and network symbols. For example, other parts of the project may use the `ConnectorNames` enum to determine which type of connector to use for a given user. Similarly, the `NETWORK_SYMBOL` object may be used to display network information to users or to perform network-specific operations. 

Here is an example of how the `ConnectorNames` enum might be used in the larger project:

```
import { ConnectorNames } from 'zoo';

const connector = getConnector(); // some function that returns a ConnectorNames value
if (connector === ConnectorNames.Injected) {
  // use MetaMask or other injected connector
} else if (connector === ConnectorNames.WalletConnect) {
  // use WalletConnect
} else if (connector === ConnectorNames.BSC) {
  // use Binance Smart Chain
} else {
  // handle other cases
}
```

And here is an example of how the `NETWORK_SYMBOL` object might be used:

```
import { ChainId, getNetwork } from '@zoolabs/zdk';
import { NETWORK_SYMBOL } from 'zoo';

const chainId = getNetwork().chainId; // get the current chain ID from the ZDK library
const networkSymbol = NETWORK_SYMBOL[chainId]; // look up the network symbol based on the chain ID
console.log(`Current network symbol: ${networkSymbol}`);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ConnectorNames` enum?
   - The `ConnectorNames` enum is used to define the different types of connectors that can be used to connect to the zoo project, including `Injected`, `WalletConnect`, and `BSC`.

2. What is the `NETWORK_SYMBOL` constant used for?
   - The `NETWORK_SYMBOL` constant is used to map the `ChainId` enum values to their corresponding network symbols, such as `ETH` for the `MAINNET` and `RINKEBY` chains.

3. Why are some of the `ChainId` values commented out in the `NETWORK_SYMBOL` constant?
   - Some of the `ChainId` values are commented out in the `NETWORK_SYMBOL` constant because they are not currently being used in the zoo project, but may be used in the future.
