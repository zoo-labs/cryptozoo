[View code on GitHub](zoo-labs/zoo/blob/master/core/src/modals/ExpandNftModal/index.tsx)

The code is a React component that renders a modal for displaying an expanded view of an NFT (non-fungible token) asset. The component imports several hooks and components from other files in the project, including `useRouter` from the `next/router` package, `useExpandNFTModal` and `useModalOpen` from the `application/hooks` module, and `Modal` and `ModalHeader` from the `components` directory. The component also imports a dynamic component called `ModelViewer` from the `components` directory using the `next/dynamic` package.

The `NFTExpandedModal` component takes two props: `nft`, which is an object representing the NFT asset to be displayed, and `isAuction`, which is a boolean indicating whether the NFT is being displayed in the context of an auction. The component uses the `useModalOpen` and `useExpandNFTModal` hooks to manage the state of the modal, which is opened and closed by clicking on the NFT asset in the main view of the application.

The `getModalContent` function returns the JSX markup for the modal, which consists of a black background with a close button in the top right corner, and a centered display area for the NFT asset. The display area contains either a video or a 3D model, depending on the type of NFT asset being displayed. If the NFT is a video, the component renders a `video` element with the `autoPlay` and `loop` attributes set, and the `src` attribute set to the `animation_url` or `token_uri` property of the `nft` object, depending on the value of `isAuction`. If the NFT is a 3D model, the component renders a `ModelViewer` component with the `glb` and `usdz` properties set to the `glb_animation_url` and `usdz_animation_url` properties of the `nft` object, respectively.

The `NFTExpandedModal` component is used in the larger project to provide a way for users to view NFT assets in more detail, including animations and 3D models. The component is designed to be used in conjunction with other components and hooks in the project, such as the main view of the application and the `useModalOpen` and `useExpandNFTModal` hooks, to provide a seamless user experience. An example of how the `NFTExpandedModal` component might be used in the project is as follows:

```
import NFTExpandedModal from 'zoo/components/NFTExpandedModal';

function App() {
  const [selectedNFT, setSelectedNFT] = useState(null);

  function handleNFTClick(nft) {
    setSelectedNFT(nft);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {/* main view of the application */}
      <NFTGrid onNFTClick={handleNFTClick} />

      {/* modal for expanded NFT view */}
      {selectedNFT && (
        <NFTExpandedModal nft={selectedNFT} isAuction={false} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines a React component called `NFTExpandedModal` that renders a modal with content based on the `nft` and `isAuction` props passed to it. The content can be either a video or a 3D model viewer.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `React`, `next/router`, `next/dynamic`, and several custom hooks defined in `../../state/application/hooks`.

3. What is the purpose of the `ssr: false` option passed to `next/dynamic`?
- The `ssr: false` option tells Next.js to only load the `ModelViewer` component on the client side, rather than during server-side rendering. This is necessary because the `ModelViewer` component relies on WebGL, which is not available during server-side rendering.
