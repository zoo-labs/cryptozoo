The `Checkbox` component is an input element styled to have a height of 20 pixels and no margin. It can be used to create checkboxes in forms. 

The `PaddedColumn` component is a container with 20 pixels of padding. It can be used to create columns of content with consistent spacing. 

The `MenuItem` component is a container with a height of 56 pixels and a grid layout that can be used to display menu items. It has four columns, with the second column taking up the remaining space. 

The `SearchInput` component is an input element styled to have a padding of 16 pixels and a border radius of 10 pixels. It can be used to create search bars or input fields. 

The `Separator` and `SeparatorDark` components are horizontal lines with a height of 1 pixel. They can be used to separate content on a page.
