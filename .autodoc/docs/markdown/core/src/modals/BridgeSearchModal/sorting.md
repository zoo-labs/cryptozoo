This code defines a set of functions that are used to compare and sort tokens based on their balances and symbols. The functions are used in the larger project to display a list of tokens in a dropdown menu, with the most relevant tokens appearing at the top of the list.

The `balanceComparator` function takes two token amounts as input and returns a number that indicates which token has the higher balance. If both balances are defined, the function compares them and returns -1 if the first balance is higher, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if the second balance is higher. If only one balance is defined and it is greater than 0, the function returns -1 or 1 depending on which balance is defined. If neither balance is defined or they are both 0, the function returns 0.

The `getTokenComparator` function takes an array of token balances as input and returns a function that can be used to sort tokens based on their balances and symbols. The function first sorts the tokens by their balances using the `balanceComparator` function. If the balances are equal, the function sorts the tokens by their symbols in alphabetical order. If one or both tokens do not have a symbol, they are sorted to the end of the list.

The `useTokenComparator` function is a React hook that takes a boolean value as input and returns a function that can be used to sort tokens. The function first calls the `useAllTokenBalances` hook to get an array of token balances. It then calls the `getTokenComparator` function to get a comparator function based on the balances. If the input boolean value is true, the function returns a comparator function that sorts tokens in reverse order. Otherwise, it returns the original comparator function.

Here is an example of how the `useTokenComparator` function might be used in the larger project:

```jsx
import { useTokenComparator } from 'zoo'

function TokenSelect({ tokens }) {
  const tokenComparator = useTokenComparator(false)

  return (
    <select>
      {tokens.sort(tokenComparator).map(token => (
        <option key={token.symbol} value={token.symbol}>
          {token.symbol}
        </option>
      ))}
    </select>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `TokenSelect` component takes an array of tokens as input and uses the `useTokenComparator` hook to get a comparator function. It then sorts the tokens using the comparator function and renders them in a dropdown menu. The most relevant tokens will appear at the top of the list based on their balances and symbols.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useTokenComparator` function?
- The `useTokenComparator` function returns a comparator function that can be used to sort an array of `Token` objects based on their balances and symbols.

2. What is the `balanceComparator` function used for?
- The `balanceComparator` function is used to compare two token amounts with the highest one coming first, and is used as part of the `getTokenComparator` function.

3. What is the significance of the `inverted` parameter in the `useTokenComparator` function?
- The `inverted` parameter determines whether the comparator function should sort in ascending or descending order, and is used to reverse the order of the sorting if `inverted` is `true`.
