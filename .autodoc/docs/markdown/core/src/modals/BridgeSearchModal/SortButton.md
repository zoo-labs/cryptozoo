This code defines a React component called `SortButton` that renders a clickable button with an up or down arrow icon, depending on the value of the `ascending` prop. The button is wrapped in a styled component called `FilterWrapper`, which applies some basic styling such as padding, border radius, and a dark background color. 

The `SortButton` component takes two props: `toggleSortOrder`, which is a function that toggles the sorting order (i.e. ascending or descending), and `ascending`, which is a boolean value indicating whether the current sort order is ascending or not. When the button is clicked, the `toggleSortOrder` function is called, which updates the sorting order and triggers a re-render of the component.

This component can be used in a larger project that requires sorting functionality, such as a table or list of items that can be sorted by a certain criteria. By passing in the `toggleSortOrder` function and `ascending` prop, the `SortButton` component can be used to toggle the sorting order and display the current sort direction to the user.

Here's an example of how the `SortButton` component could be used in a table component:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import SortButton from './SortButton'

function Table() {
  const [ascending, setAscending] = useState(true)
  const [data, setData] = useState([...]) // array of data to be sorted

  function toggleSortOrder() {
    setAscending(!ascending)
    // sort data based on current ascending value
    setData([...])
  }

  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Age</th>
          <th>
            <SortButton toggleSortOrder={toggleSortOrder} ascending={ascending} />
            {/* display column name */}
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {/* render table rows */}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `Table` component maintains the state of the sorting order and the data to be sorted. The `SortButton` component is rendered in the header of the table column that can be sorted. When the button is clicked, the `toggleSortOrder` function is called, which updates the state and triggers a re-sorting of the data. The sorted data is then rendered in the table rows.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `FilterWrapper` component?
- The `FilterWrapper` component is a styled div that provides padding, border radius, and hover effects. It also prevents user selection and applies the same style to its child elements.

2. What does the `SortButton` component do?
- The `SortButton` component is a functional component that renders a `FilterWrapper` with a text content of either '↑' or '↓' depending on the value of the `ascending` prop. It also accepts a `toggleSortOrder` function as a prop that is called when the component is clicked.

3. What external libraries are being used in this file?
- This file is using two external libraries: `React` and `styled-components`. `React` is used to define and render the components, while `styled-components` is used to create the `FilterWrapper` component with custom styles.
