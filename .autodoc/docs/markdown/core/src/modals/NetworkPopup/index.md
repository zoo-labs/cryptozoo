The code is a React component that renders a network popup menu for a web3-enabled application. The popup displays a list of available networks and allows the user to switch between them. The component uses the `@headlessui/react` library to create the popup and the `next-themes` library to handle theme switching. 

The `NetworkPopup` component takes two props: `userEthBalance` and `NATIVE`. `userEthBalance` is the user's ETH balance, and `NATIVE` is an object that maps network IDs to their native tokens. 

The component uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook from the `hooks` directory to get the current chain ID, library, and account. If there is no chain ID, the component returns `null`. 

The component then renders a `Popover` component from `@headlessui/react`. The `Popover` component takes a function as a child that returns an object with an `open` property. The `open` property is `true` when the popup is open and `false` when it is closed. 

The `Popover` component renders a button that displays the user's ETH balance and symbol. When the button is clicked, the popup opens, displaying a list of available networks. The list is rendered using the `AVAILABLE_NETWORKS` array from the `config/networks` file. 

For each network in the list, the component renders a button that displays the network's name and icon. If the network is the current network, the button is disabled and displays a green dot to indicate that it is selected. If the network is not the current network, the button is clickable and switches the user to that network when clicked. 

The component uses the `cookie-cutter` library to set the `chainId` cookie when the user switches networks. It also uses the `library` object to call the `wallet_switchEthereumChain` or `wallet_addEthereumChain` method to switch networks in the user's wallet. 

Overall, this component provides a simple and intuitive way for users to switch between networks in a web3-enabled application. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import NetworkPopup from "./components/NetworkPopup";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <NetworkPopup userEthBalance={0.5} NATIVE={{1: {symbol: "ETH"}}} />
      {/* rest of the app */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code exports a React component called `NetworkPopup` that renders a popover with a list of available networks and allows the user to switch between them.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code imports several external libraries and dependencies, including "@headlessui/react", "next/link", "../../functions/styling", "next-themes", "hooks/useActiveWeb3React", "config/networks", "next/image", and "cookie-cutter".

3. What is the purpose of the `useActiveWeb3React` hook?
- The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to retrieve the current chain ID, library, and account from the user's active Web3 provider. These values are used to determine which network the user is currently connected to and to switch between networks when the user selects a different one from the popover.
