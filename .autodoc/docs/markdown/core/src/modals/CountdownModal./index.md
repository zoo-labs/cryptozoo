The `CooldownModal` component is a React functional component that displays a modal window with information about the cooldown time for breeding animals in the Zoo project. The component imports several modules from the project, including `React`, `ApplicationModal`, `useCountdownToggle`, `useModalOpen`, `Modal`, `BidModalHeader`, `MyNFT`, `ModalHeader`, and `Image`. 

The component takes no props and returns a JSX element that renders a modal window with a header, an image, and some text. The header contains a close button that dismisses the modal window. The image is a snowflake icon that is displayed at the top of the modal window. The text explains that the cooldown time for breeding animals is 24 hours and that the cooldown helps protect the animals from Lorem. The text also displays a countdown timer that shows the remaining time until the next breeding opportunity. The timer is displayed in the format of hours:minutes:seconds. 

The `CooldownModal` component is used in the larger Zoo project to provide users with information about the cooldown time for breeding animals. When a user attempts to breed an animal, the `CooldownModal` component is displayed to inform the user of the cooldown time and to provide a countdown timer that shows the remaining time until the next breeding opportunity. The component is also used to protect the animals from Lorem by enforcing a cooldown period between breeding attempts. 

Here is an example of how the `CooldownModal` component might be used in the Zoo project:

```jsx
import CooldownModal from "components/CooldownModal";

function BreedAnimal() {
  const [showModal, setShowModal] = useState(false);

  function handleBreed() {
    // perform breeding logic
    setShowModal(true);
  }

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleBreed}>Breed Animal</button>
      {showModal && <CooldownModal />}
    </>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `BreedAnimal` component renders a button that triggers the `handleBreed` function when clicked. The `handleBreed` function performs the breeding logic and sets the `showModal` state to `true`, which displays the `CooldownModal` component. When the user dismisses the modal window, the `showModal` state is set to `false`, and the modal window is hidden.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a React component that renders a modal for displaying cooldown information for a specific NFT item.

2. What are the props for the `NftModalProps` interface?
- The `NftModalProps` interface has three functions as props: `hatchEgg`, `feed`, `breed`, and `auction`. It also has a `nftItem` prop of type `MyNFT`.

3. What is the purpose of the `CooldownModal` component?
- The `CooldownModal` component is a specific implementation of the `Modal` component that displays cooldown information for a specific NFT item. It uses the `useModalOpen` and `useCountdownToggle` hooks from the `state/application/hooks` module to manage the modal's visibility.
