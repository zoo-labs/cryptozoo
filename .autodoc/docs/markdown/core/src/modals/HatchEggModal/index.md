This code defines a React component called `HatchEggModal` that renders a modal for hatching an egg. The modal is opened by calling the `useHatchEggModal` hook from the `application` state slice. The modal displays a video of the egg and a button to hatch it. The button is disabled if the user is not logged in or if the egg is still in the process of hatching. 

The component uses several hooks from the `web3-react`, `zoo`, and `hooks` libraries. The `useWeb3React` hook provides access to the user's Ethereum account, which is used to hatch the egg. The `useSelector` hook is used to retrieve the `loading` state from the `zoo` slice of the Redux store. The `useHatch` hook is used to hatch the egg. The `useMedia` hook is used to determine the user's screen size, and the `useZooToken` hook is used to retrieve the `ZooToken` contract instance. 

The component also defines a `WALLET_VIEWS` object that maps different views of the wallet modal to string keys. 

The `HatchEggModal` component takes two props: `nftItem` and `success`. `nftItem` is an object that contains information about the egg, including its `dropId` and `token_uri`. `success` is a callback function that is called when the egg is successfully hatched. 

The `HatchEggModal` component renders a `Modal` component from the `components` directory. The `Modal` component is used to display the egg hatching modal. The `Modal` component takes several props, including `isOpen`, `onDismiss`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight`, `padding`, and `maxWidth`. 

The `HatchEggModal` component defines several functions, including `toggleModal`, `toggleWallet`, `handleHatchEgg`, and `getModalContent`. `toggleModal` is a function that toggles the visibility of the egg hatching modal. `toggleWallet` is a function that toggles the visibility of the wallet modal. `handleHatchEgg` is a function that is called when the user clicks the hatch button. It checks if the user is logged in and then calls the `hatchEgg` function to hatch the egg. If the user is not logged in, it calls the `toggleWallet` function to open the wallet modal. `getModalContent` is a function that returns the content of the egg hatching modal. 

The `HatchEggModal` component is exported as the default export of the file and can be used in other parts of the `zoo` project by importing it and rendering it. For example, it could be used in a page that displays the user's inventory of eggs and allows them to hatch them. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import HatchEggModal from "./path/to/HatchEggModal";

function EggInventory({ eggs }) {
  const [selectedEgg, setSelectedEgg] = useState(null);

  function handleHatchSuccess() {
    // do something when egg is hatched
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {eggs.map((egg) => (
        <div key={egg.id} onClick={() => setSelectedEgg(egg)}>
          <img src={egg.image} alt={egg.name} />
        </div>
      ))}
      {selectedEgg && (
        <HatchEggModal nftItem={selectedEgg} success={handleHatchSuccess} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useHatch` hook and how is it used in this code?
- The `useHatch` hook is used to hatch an egg by calling the `hatchEgg` function with the appropriate parameters. It is used in the `handleHatchEgg` function to hatch the egg when the "Hatch Egg" button is clicked.

2. What is the significance of the `WALLET_VIEWS` object?
- The `WALLET_VIEWS` object is used to define the different views of the wallet modal. It is used to determine which view to display when the wallet modal is opened.

3. What is the purpose of the commented out code related to calculating the time left for hatching an egg?
- The commented out code is used to calculate the time left for hatching an egg based on the egg's timestamp and the `HATCH_EGG_WAIT_PERIOD` environment variable. It is not currently being used in the code, but may have been used in a previous version or may be used in a future version.
