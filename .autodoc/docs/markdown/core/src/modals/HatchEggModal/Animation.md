The `HatchEggAnimationModal` component is a React component that displays an animation of an egg hatching. The component is used as a modal in the larger project and is triggered when a user hatches an egg. The modal displays the animation and redirects the user to the wallet page once the animation is complete.

The component imports two hooks from the `application` state: `useHatchEggAnimationModal` and `useModalOpen`. These hooks are used to manage the state of the modal. The `useHatchEggAnimationModal` hook is used to toggle the modal on and off, while the `useModalOpen` hook is used to check if the modal is open.

The component also imports the `useRouter` hook from `next/router`. This hook is used to redirect the user to the wallet page once the animation is complete.

The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the animation. The `useEffect` hook is used to set the animation based on the name of the egg that was hatched. If the name of the egg matches one of the cases in the switch statement, the corresponding animation is set. If the name of the egg does not match any of the cases, a default animation is set.

The `getModalContent` function returns the content of the modal. It contains a `video` element that displays the animation. The `onEnded` event listener is used to check if the animation has ended. If the animation has ended and the modal is open, the `toggleModal` function is called to close the modal. The `push` function is used to redirect the user to the wallet page.

The `Modal` component is used to display the content of the modal. It receives the `isOpen`, `onDismiss`, `minHeight`, and `isMax` props. The `isOpen` prop is used to check if the modal is open, the `onDismiss` prop is used to close the modal, the `minHeight` prop is used to set the minimum height of the modal, and the `isMax` prop is used to set the maximum height of the modal.

Example usage:

```jsx
import HatchEggAnimationModal from "./path/to/HatchEggAnimationModal";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => hatchEgg()}>Hatch Egg</button>
      <HatchEggAnimationModal nft={nft} />
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is for a React component that displays a modal for hatching an egg animation.

2. What is the significance of the `useModalOpen` and `useHatchEggAnimationModal` hooks?
- The `useModalOpen` hook is used to determine if the hatch egg animation modal is currently open. The `useHatchEggAnimationModal` hook is used to toggle the hatch egg animation modal.

3. What is the purpose of the `switch` statement in the `useEffect` hook?
- The `switch` statement sets the animation URL based on the name of the NFT (non-fungible token) passed as a prop to the component. If the name does not match any of the cases, a default animation is used. However, the `switch` statement is missing `break` statements, which may cause unexpected behavior.
