This code defines a React component called `AuctionModal` that is used to create or edit auctions for animals in a virtual zoo. The component is imported into other parts of the project and is used to display a modal window with a form for creating or editing auctions.

The component imports several hooks from the project's state management system, including `useModalOpen`, `useAuctionModal`, and `useWalletModalToggle`. It also imports two custom hooks from the `state/zoo/hooks` module called `useCreateAuction` and `useEditAuction`. These hooks provide access to functions for creating and editing auctions.

The `AuctionModal` component takes two props: `nft` and `edit`. `nft` is an object that represents the animal being auctioned, and `edit` is a boolean flag that indicates whether the auction is being created or edited.

The component renders a `Modal` component from the project's `components` directory. The `Modal` component is a reusable component that displays a modal window with a header and content. The content of the modal is generated by the `getModalContent` function, which returns a form with input fields for the auction's duration, reserve price, and curator fee.

The `handleAuction` function is called when the user submits the form. It checks if the user is logged in and either creates a new auction or edits an existing one using the `useCreateAuction` and `useEditAuction` hooks. If the user is not logged in, the `toggleWallet` function is called to display a wallet modal.

The `successCallback` function is called when an auction is successfully created or edited. It closes the auction modal and redirects the user to the market page.

Overall, this code provides a way for users to create and edit auctions for animals in the virtual zoo. It uses several hooks and custom functions to manage the state of the auction creation/editing process and displays a modal window with a form for inputting auction details.
