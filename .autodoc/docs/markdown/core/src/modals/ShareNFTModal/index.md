The `ShareNFTModal` component is a React component that renders a modal for sharing an NFT (non-fungible token) on social media platforms. The component imports two custom hooks from the `application` slice of the Redux store: `useModalOpen` and `useShareModal`. It also imports the `ApplicationModal` enum from the same slice, which is used to identify the modal being opened. Additionally, the component imports the `Modal` and `ModalHeader` components from the `components` directory, and several social media icons from the `react-icons` library.

The component takes two props: `nft`, which is an object representing the NFT being shared, and `edit`, which is a boolean indicating whether the NFT is being edited. The `nft` prop is required, while the `edit` prop is optional and defaults to `false`.

The `ShareNFTModal` component renders a modal that contains links to share the NFT on Twitter, Discord, and Gmail. The modal is opened and closed using the `modalOpen` and `toggleModal` variables, which are obtained from the `useModalOpen` and `useShareModal` hooks, respectively. The `getModalContent` function returns the JSX for the modal's content, which includes a header, a container for the social media links, and the links themselves. The links are styled with CSS classes and contain icons from the `react-icons` library.

When the user clicks on the Twitter link, a new window is opened with a pre-populated tweet that includes the NFT's URL. When the user clicks on the Discord link, a new window is opened that prompts the user to authorize a Discord bot with certain permissions. The URL for the authorization request includes the NFT's ID as a state parameter. When the user clicks on the Gmail link, a new email is opened with the NFT's URL in the body.

Overall, the `ShareNFTModal` component provides a convenient way for users to share NFTs on social media platforms. It can be used in conjunction with other components in the `zoo` project to create a seamless user experience for buying, selling, and sharing NFTs. For example, it could be used in conjunction with a component that displays a user's NFT collection, allowing the user to easily share their collection with others.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a React component called `ShareNFTModal` that displays a modal with social media sharing options for an NFT (non-fungible token).

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `react`, `react-icons`, and custom hooks from a `../../state/application` module.

3. What is the significance of the `edit` prop?
- The `edit` prop is an optional boolean value that defaults to `false`. It is not used within this component, but may be passed down to child components for conditional rendering based on whether the modal is being used for editing or sharing.
