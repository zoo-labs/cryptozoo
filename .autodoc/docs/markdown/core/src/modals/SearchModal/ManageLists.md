The `ManageLists` component is responsible for rendering a list of token lists that can be managed by the user. It imports various components and hooks from other files in the project, including `AppDispatch`, `AppState`, `CheckCircle`, `Settings`, `AutoColumn`, `Row`, `RowBetween`, `RowFixed`, `useActiveListUrls`, `useAllLists`, `useIsListActive`, `useDispatch`, `useSelector`, `Button`, `CurrencyModalView`, `ExternalLink`, `ListLogo`, `ListToggle`, `ReactGA`, `TokenList`, `UNSUPPORTED_LIST_URLS`, `listVersionLabel`, `parseENSAddress`, `uriToHttp`, `useFetchListCallback`, `usePopper`, `classNames`, and `Popover`.

The `ManageLists` component renders an input field where the user can enter a URL or ENS name for a token list they want to import. As the user types, the component fetches the details of the list and displays them in a card below the input field. If the list is already imported, the component displays a checkmark and the text "Loaded" instead of the import button. If there is an error with the input or fetching the list, an error message is displayed.

The component also renders a list of all the token lists that have been imported by the user. Each list is displayed as a row with the list's logo, name, and number of tokens. The row also includes a toggle button that allows the user to enable or disable the list, a settings button that opens a popover with options to remove or update the list, and a background color that indicates whether the list is active or not.

The `ListRow` component is used to render each row in the list. It takes a `listUrl` prop and uses it to retrieve the corresponding list from the Redux store. It then renders the logo, name, and number of tokens for the list, along with the toggle and settings buttons. The component also handles user interactions with the buttons, such as enabling or disabling the list, removing the list, or updating the list.

Overall, the `ManageLists` component provides a user-friendly interface for managing token lists in the project. It allows the user to easily import new lists, view details of existing lists, and enable or disable them as needed.
