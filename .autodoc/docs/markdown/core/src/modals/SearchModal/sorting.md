The code imports `Currency`, `CurrencyAmount`, and `Token` from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, as well as `useAllTokenBalances` and `useMemo` from `react`. It then defines a `balanceComparator` function that takes two optional `CurrencyAmount` arguments and returns a number indicating their relative order. The function first checks if both arguments are defined, and if so, compares them using the `greaterThan` and `equalTo` methods of `CurrencyAmount`. If only one argument is defined and greater than zero, it is considered greater than the other. If neither argument is defined or greater than zero, they are considered equal. 

The `getTokenComparator` function takes an object of `CurrencyAmount` values indexed by token addresses and returns a comparator function that takes two `Token` arguments and returns a number indicating their relative order. The comparator first compares the balances of the two tokens using the `balanceComparator` function, and if they are equal, it compares their symbols using the `toLowerCase` method. If one or both tokens do not have a symbol, they are considered equal to other tokens without symbols.

The `useTokenComparator` function takes a boolean `inverted` argument and returns a memoized comparator function that takes two `Token` arguments and returns a number indicating their relative order. It first calls `useAllTokenBalances` to get an object of `CurrencyAmount` values indexed by token addresses, and then calls `getTokenComparator` with this object to get a comparator function. If `inverted` is true, it returns a new comparator function that reverses the order of the original comparator function by multiplying its result by -1. Otherwise, it returns the original comparator function.

This code can be used to sort lists of tokens by balance and symbol, such as in a wallet or exchange interface. For example, to sort an array of `Token` objects called `tokens` in ascending order by balance and symbol, you could call `tokens.sort(useTokenComparator(false))`. To sort them in descending order, you could call `tokens.sort(useTokenComparator(true))`.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useTokenComparator` function?
- The `useTokenComparator` function returns a comparator function that can be used to sort an array of `Token` objects based on their balances and symbols.

2. What is the significance of the `inverted` parameter in `useTokenComparator`?
- The `inverted` parameter determines whether the comparator function should sort the tokens in ascending or descending order based on their balances and symbols.

3. What is the role of the `balances` object in `getTokenComparator`?
- The `balances` object is used to look up the balance of each token in the `Token` array being sorted, and then compare the balances to determine their order.
