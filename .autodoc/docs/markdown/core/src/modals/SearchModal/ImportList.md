The `ImportList` component is responsible for rendering a modal that allows users to import a token list from a URL. The component is imported from the `zoo` project and uses various other components and hooks from the project.

The component takes in a `listURL`, `list`, `setModalView`, and `onDismiss` as props. The `listURL` is the URL of the token list to be imported, `list` is the token list object, `setModalView` is a function to set the modal view, and `onDismiss` is a function to dismiss the modal.

The component renders a header with a title "Import List" and a back button to go back to the previous view. It also renders the name and logo of the token list, the number of tokens in the list, and a link to the token list URL. The component also renders a warning message that the user is importing the list at their own risk and that they are implicitly trusting that the data is correct. The user is also warned that if they purchase a token from this list, they may not be able to sell it back. The user must confirm that they understand the risks by checking a checkbox before they can import the list.

The component uses the `useAllLists` hook to get all the lists, the `useFetchListCallback` hook to fetch the list from the URL, and the `useDispatch` hook to dispatch actions to the store. The component dispatches an `enableList` action to turn on the list and a `removeList` action to remove the list if there is an error. The component also uses the `ReactGA` library to track events when the user adds a list or when adding a list fails.

The `ImportList` component is used in the `CurrencyModal` component, which is responsible for rendering a modal that allows users to manage their token lists. The `ImportList` component is used when the user clicks on the "Import List" button in the `CurrencyModal` component. The `ImportList` component is a reusable component that can be used in other parts of the project where importing a token list is required.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code defines a React component called `ImportList` that renders a modal for importing a token list and adds it to the user's list of token lists.

2. What external libraries does this code use?
- This code uses several external libraries, including `react-feather`, `react`, `@uniswap/token-lists`, `react-redux`, `react-ga`, and `@lingui/react`.

3. What user actions trigger changes in the state of this component?
- The user must check a checkbox to confirm that they understand the risks of importing a token list, and then click a button to import the list. This triggers a call to the `fetchList` function, which loads the list from the specified URL and adds it to the user's list of token lists. If the import fails, an error message is displayed.
