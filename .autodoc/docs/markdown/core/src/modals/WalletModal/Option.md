The `Option` component is a reusable React component that renders an option item with an icon, header, and subheader. It can be used in various parts of the larger project, such as a navigation menu or a settings page. 

The component takes in several props, including `link`, `clickable`, `size`, `onClick`, `color`, `header`, `subheader`, `icon`, `active`, and `id`. 

The `link` prop is an optional string that specifies the URL to link to when the option is clicked. If `link` is provided, the component returns an anchor tag with the `content` as its child. If `link` is not provided, the component returns the `content` div.

The `clickable` prop is a boolean that determines whether the option is clickable or not. If `clickable` is `false`, the cursor is set to `not-allowed`.

The `size` prop is an optional number that specifies the size of the option. If `size` is not provided, the default size is used.

The `onClick` prop is an optional function that is called when the option is clicked.

The `color` prop is a required string that specifies the background color of the option.

The `header` prop is a required React node that specifies the main text of the option.

The `subheader` prop is an optional React node that specifies the subtext of the option.

The `icon` prop is a required string that specifies the URL of the icon to display.

The `active` prop is a boolean that determines whether the option is active or not. If `active` is `true`, the option is highlighted with a gradient background.

The `id` prop is a required string that specifies the ID of the option.

The `content` variable is a div that contains the header, subheader, and icon. The header and subheader are wrapped in divs with appropriate styles. The icon is an `Image` component from the `next/image` library.

If `link` is provided, the `content` div is returned as a child of an anchor tag. If `link` is not provided and `active` is `false`, the `content` div is returned. If `link` is not provided and `active` is `true`, the `content` div is returned as a child of a div with a gradient background.

Example usage:

```
<Option
  link="/home"
  clickable={true}
  size={24}
  onClick={() => console.log("Option clicked")}
  color="#FF0000"
  header="Home"
  subheader="Go to the homepage"
  icon="/icons/home.svg"
  active={false}
  id="home-option"
/>
```
