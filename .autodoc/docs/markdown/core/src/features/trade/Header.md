The `ExchangeHeader` component is a React functional component that renders a header for the exchange page of the Zoo project. The header contains three buttons for swapping, creating limit orders, and adding/removing liquidity, respectively. The component also includes a gas fee estimator and a settings button.

The component takes three props: `input`, `output`, and `allowedSlippage`. `input` and `output` are optional Currency objects that represent the input and output tokens for the exchange. `allowedSlippage` is an optional Percent object that represents the maximum allowed slippage for the exchange.

The `getQuery` function is a helper function that takes `input` and `output` as arguments and returns an object with `inputCurrency` and `outputCurrency` properties. If `input` is not provided, the `inputCurrency` property defaults to `"ETH"`. If neither `input` nor `output` is provided, the function returns `undefined`.

The `ExchangeHeader` component uses the `useLingui` hook from the `@lingui/react` package to provide internationalization support. It also uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook from the Zoo project to get the current chain ID.

The component renders a `div` element with two child elements: a `div` element containing the three buttons, and a `div` element containing the gas fee estimator and the settings button.

The three buttons are implemented as `NavLink` components from the Zoo project. Each `NavLink` component has an `href` prop that points to a different page of the exchange, depending on the current input and output tokens. The `getQuery` function is used to generate the query parameters for the `href` prop.

The gas fee estimator is implemented as a `Gas` component from the Zoo project. It displays the estimated gas fee for the current transaction.

The settings button is implemented as a `Settings` component from the Zoo project. It opens a modal dialog that allows the user to adjust the slippage tolerance and other settings.

Overall, the `ExchangeHeader` component provides a convenient and user-friendly interface for the exchange page of the Zoo project. It allows users to easily swap tokens, create limit orders, and add/remove liquidity, while also providing important information about gas fees and settings.
