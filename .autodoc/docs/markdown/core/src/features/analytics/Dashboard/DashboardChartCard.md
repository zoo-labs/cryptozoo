The code is a React component that renders a ChartCard displaying either TVL (total value locked) or volume data for a given time period. The component takes a prop called `type`, which is either `'liquidity'` or `'volume'`. The `types` object contains two properties, one for each type of data. Each property contains a `header` string and a `getData` function that returns an object with `figure`, `change`, and `chart` properties. 

The `DashboardChartCard` component uses several hooks from the `graph` and `hooks` services to fetch data. The `useActiveWeb3React` hook returns the current chain ID. The `useBlock` hook returns the block number for a given number of days ago. The `useFactory` hook returns data about the SushiSwap exchange, including liquidity and volume data. The `useDayData` hook returns an array of daily data points for a given time period. 

The `useState` hook is used to manage the `chartTimespan` state, which determines the time period for the chart. The `chartTimespans` array contains four options: `'1W'`, `'1M'`, `'1Y'`, and `'ALL'`. 

The `data` variable is computed using the `useMemo` hook, which only recomputes the value when its dependencies change. The `type.getData` function is called with the exchange data, the exchange data from one day ago, the exchange data from two days ago, and the day data for the selected time period. The resulting object is passed as props to the `ChartCard` component. 

Overall, this code provides a reusable component for displaying liquidity or volume data for the SushiSwap exchange. It uses several hooks to fetch data and allows the user to select a time period for the chart. Here is an example of how the component might be used in a larger project:

```
import DashboardChartCard from './DashboardChartCard'

function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div>
      <DashboardChartCard type="liquidity" />
      <DashboardChartCard type="volume" />
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useMemo` hook in this code?
- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of the `type.getData` function, which is called with four arguments: `exchange`, `exchange1d`, `exchange2d`, and `dayData`. This means that the function will only be re-executed if one of these arguments changes.

2. What is the significance of the `DashboardChartCardProps` interface?
- The `DashboardChartCardProps` interface defines the props that can be passed to the `DashboardChartCard` component. In this case, it specifies that the `type` prop must be either `'liquidity'` or `'volume'`.

3. What is the purpose of the `useActiveWeb3React` hook in this code?
- The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to get the `chainId` value, which is then passed as an argument to several other hooks (`useBlock`, `useFactory`, and `useDayData`). This allows these hooks to retrieve data specific to the current blockchain network.
