This code defines several custom hooks that are used to fetch and format data related to user activity on various chains in the larger project. 

The `useUserPairs` hook fetches and formats data related to the liquidity positions of the user on a given chain. It uses the `useLiquidityPositions` and `useSushiPairs` hooks to fetch the user's liquidity positions and the corresponding SushiSwap pairs respectively. It then formats this data to include the user's balance in the liquidity pool in both token and USD terms. 

The `useUserFarms` hook fetches and formats data related to the user's activity in liquidity mining pools on a given chain. It uses the `usePositions`, `useFarms`, `useSushiPairs`, and `useKashiPairs` hooks to fetch the user's positions, the farms they are in, and the corresponding SushiSwap and Kashi pairs respectively. It then formats this data to include the user's staked balance in both token and USD terms. 

The `useBentoUserTokens` hook fetches and formats data related to the user's activity in the BentoBox protocol on a given chain. It uses the `useGetBentoUserTokens` and `useTokens` hooks to fetch the user's BentoBox tokens and the corresponding token data respectively. It then formats this data to include the value of the user's tokens in USD terms. 

The `useUserKashiPairs` hook fetches and formats data related to the user's activity in the Kashi protocol on a given chain. It uses the `useGetUserKashiPairs` and `useTokens` hooks to fetch the user's Kashi pairs and the corresponding token data respectively. It then formats this data to include the value of the user's positions in USD terms. 

The `useUserAssets` hook fetches and formats data related to the user's assets on various chains. It uses the `useAssets` hook to fetch the user's assets and formats this data to include the value of the user's assets in USD terms. 

These hooks are used to provide data to various components in the larger project, such as the user dashboard and portfolio pages. For example, the `useUserPairs` hook may be used to display the user's liquidity positions and balances in a table or chart format. Similarly, the `useUserFarms` hook may be used to display the user's liquidity mining positions and rewards. Overall, these hooks provide a convenient way to fetch and format data related to user activity on various chains in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useAllUserPairs` function?
- The `useAllUserPairs` function returns an array of all liquidity pool pairs that the user has a position in across all chains that support AMM feature.

2. What data does the `useUserFarms` function return?
- The `useUserFarms` function returns an array of all farms that the user has a position in for a given chain, along with additional data such as the type of farm, user staked token and USD value, and the chain ID.

3. What is the purpose of the `useUserAssets` function?
- The `useUserAssets` function returns an array of all assets that the user holds across different chains, along with additional data such as the token symbol, amount, and USD value. It filters out assets of type "sushi" since they are covered by the `useUserPairs` function.
