This code defines a React component called `TopFarmsList` that renders a table of top farms. The component takes a single prop called `farms`, which is an array of objects representing each farm. Each farm object has three properties: `pair`, `roi`, and `rewards`. The `pair` property is an object with two properties, `token0` and `token1`, each of which has an `id` and a `symbol`. The `roi` property is a number representing the return on investment for the farm, and the `rewards` property is an array of objects, each of which has an `icon` property that is a JSX element.

The `TopFarmsList` component uses the `useMemo` hook to define a `columns` array that is used to render the table. The `columns` array has three objects, each of which represents a column in the table. The first column is called "Token Pair" and displays the farm's pair of tokens as a `FarmListname` component. The `FarmListname` component takes a single prop called `pair`, which is an object with two properties, `token0` and `token1`, each of which has an `id` and a `symbol`. The `FarmListname` component uses the `useCurrency` hook to get the currency object for each token and renders a `DoubleCurrencyLogo` component with the two currencies and their symbols. The second column is called "ROI (1Y)" and displays the farm's return on investment as a percentage using the `formatPercent` function. The third column is called "Rewards" and displays the farm's rewards as a list of icons.

Finally, the `TopFarmsList` component renders a `Table` component with the `columns` array and the `farms` prop as the data. The `Table` component is conditionally rendered using the `&&` operator to only render if `farms` is truthy. The `Table` component also has a `defaultSortBy` prop that sorts the table by the "ROI (1Y)" column in descending order.

This code is used to display a table of top farms in a larger project, likely a decentralized finance (DeFi) application. The `TopFarmsList` component could be used in a dashboard or analytics page to show users which farms are performing the best. The `FarmListname` component could also be reused in other parts of the application to display a pair of tokens with their symbols and logos.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TopFarmsList` component?
- The `TopFarmsList` component is used to render a table of top farms, including their token pair, ROI, and rewards.

2. What is the `FarmListName` component used for?
- The `FarmListName` component is used to render the name of a farm's token pair, including the logos of the two currencies and their symbols.

3. What libraries and hooks are being used in this code?
- The code is importing `useMemo` from the `react` library, and is also using the `Table` component from a custom component file. Additionally, it is using the `useCurrency` hook and the `formatPercent` function from custom hook and function files, respectively.
