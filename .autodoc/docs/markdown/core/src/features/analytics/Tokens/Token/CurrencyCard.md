The code above defines a React component called `CurrencyCard`. This component is responsible for rendering a card that displays information about a cryptocurrency token. The component takes two props: `token` and `symbol`. The `token` prop is a string that represents the token's unique identifier, while the `symbol` prop is a string that represents the token's symbol.

The component imports two things: `CurrencyLogo` and `useCurrency`. `CurrencyLogo` is a custom component that renders an SVG logo for a given cryptocurrency. `useCurrency` is a custom hook that takes a token's unique identifier and returns an object that contains information about the token, such as its name, symbol, and logo URL.

The `CurrencyCard` component renders a div element with a dark background color and rounded corners. Inside this div, there is another div element that contains two child elements: a `CurrencyLogo` component and a div element that displays the token's symbol. The `CurrencyLogo` component is passed the `currency` object returned by the `useCurrency` hook, as well as a `size` prop that determines the size of the logo.

This component can be used in a larger project that displays information about cryptocurrency tokens. For example, it could be used in a dashboard that displays the user's portfolio of tokens. The `CurrencyCard` component could be used to render a card for each token in the user's portfolio, displaying the token's logo and symbol. 

Here is an example of how the `CurrencyCard` component could be used in a larger project:

```
import CurrencyCard from './components/CurrencyCard'

function Portfolio() {
  const tokens = ['eth', 'btc', 'uni']

  return (
    <div>
      {tokens.map((token) => (
        <CurrencyCard key={token} token={token} symbol={token.toUpperCase()} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `Portfolio` component renders a list of `CurrencyCard` components, one for each token in the `tokens` array. The `key` prop is set to the token's unique identifier, and the `symbol` prop is set to the token's symbol in uppercase letters.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `CurrencyCard` component?
- The `CurrencyCard` component is used to display a token's symbol and logo.

2. What is the `useCurrency` hook and where is it defined?
- The `useCurrency` hook is used to retrieve a currency object based on a given token. It is defined in the `Tokens` module located in the `hooks` directory.

3. What styling classes are applied to the `CurrencyCard` component?
- The `CurrencyCard` component has a `p-3` padding, a `rounded` border, and a `bg-dark-900` background color. It also uses flexbox to horizontally align the logo and symbol, and has a hidden `text-lg` element for the symbol on small screens.
