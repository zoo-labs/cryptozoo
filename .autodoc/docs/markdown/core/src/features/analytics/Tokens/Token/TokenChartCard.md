The `TokenChartCard` component is used to display a chart card that shows either the liquidity or volume of a specific token. The component takes in three props: `type`, `name`, and `token`. The `type` prop specifies whether the chart should display liquidity or volume data. The `name` prop is a string that represents the name of the token. The `token` prop is a string that represents the token's address.

The `TokenChartCard` component uses several hooks from the `graph` and `hooks` services to fetch data needed to display the chart. The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to get the current chain ID. The `useBlock` hook is used to get the block number for the current day, as well as the block numbers for the previous two days. The `useTokens` hook is used to get information about the token, such as its liquidity and volume. The `useNativePrice` hook is used to get the native price of the token. The `useDayData` hook is used to get daily data for the token.

The `types` object is used to define the header and data for each chart type. The `getData` function is used to calculate the figure, change, and chart data for the chart. The `figure` represents the current value of the liquidity or volume. The `change` represents the percentage change in liquidity or volume over the past day or two days. The `chart` represents an array of data points that can be used to display a chart.

The `useState` hook is used to keep track of the current timespan for the chart. The `chartTimespans` array is used to define the available timespans for the chart.

The `data` variable is calculated using the `useMemo` hook. The `data` variable is an object that contains the figure, change, and chart data for the chart. The `ChartCard` component is used to display the chart card with the data.

Overall, the `TokenChartCard` component is a reusable component that can be used to display a chart of the liquidity or volume of a specific token. The component uses several hooks to fetch data needed to display the chart, and the `types` object is used to define the header and data for each chart type. The `useState` hook is used to keep track of the current timespan for the chart, and the `ChartCard` component is used to display the chart card with the data.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code exports a React component called `TokenChartCard` that renders a chart card based on the `type`, `name`, and `token` props passed to it. The chart displays either liquidity or volume data for the specified token over a specified time period.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies imported from other files in the project, including `useBlock`, `useDayData`, `useNativePrice`, `useTokens`, and `useActiveWeb3React`. These dependencies are used to fetch data from external APIs and the blockchain.

3. What is the purpose of the `useMemo` hook in this code?
- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of calling the `type.getData` function with the current values of several variables. This helps to optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders of the component when these variables change.
