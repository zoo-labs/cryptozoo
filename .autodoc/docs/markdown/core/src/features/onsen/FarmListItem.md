The `FarmListItem` component is a React component that renders a single farm item in a list of farms. It takes a `farm` object as a prop, which contains information about the farm, such as the tokens being farmed, the TVL (total value locked), rewards, and ROI (return on investment).

The component uses the `Disclosure` component from the `@headlessui/react` library to create a collapsible section for each farm item. When the user clicks on the farm item, the section expands to show more details about the farm.

The component uses several other components and functions from the project, such as `DoubleLogo`, `Image`, `QuestionHelper`, and `useCurrency`. It also imports the `PairType` enum from another file.

The component renders the farm item using a grid layout with four columns. The first column displays the tokens being farmed, along with their logos and symbols. The second column displays the TVL of the farm. The third column displays the rewards being earned by the farm, along with their icons and reward rates. The fourth column displays the ROI of the farm, along with a tooltip that shows the reward APR and fee APY.

The component uses several utility functions to format numbers and percentages, such as `formatNumber` and `formatPercent`. It also uses the `classNames` function to conditionally apply CSS classes based on whether the farm item is open or closed.

Overall, the `FarmListItem` component is a reusable component that can be used to display a list of farms in the larger project. It provides a consistent and user-friendly way to view and interact with farms, and can be customized and extended as needed.
