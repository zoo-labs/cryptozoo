The `FarmListItemDetails` component is a React component that renders a panel containing information about a farm. The component imports several dependencies, including `React`, `useState`, `PairType` from an enum file, `Disclosure`, `Tab`, and `Transition` from the `@headlessui/react` library, `t` and `useLingui` from the `@lingui` library, `useActiveWeb3React` from a custom hook, `Token` and `ZERO` from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, `getAddress` from the `@ethersproject/address` library, and several custom hooks and components.

The component takes a `farm` object as a prop, which contains information about the farm, including the pair ID and type. The component uses this information to create a `liquidityToken` object, which is an instance of the `Token` class from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library. The `liquidityToken` object is used to retrieve the `stakedAmount` of the farm using the `useUserInfo` hook.

The component renders a `Transition` component from the `@headlessui/react` library, which animates the panel when it is shown or hidden. The panel is a `Disclosure.Panel` component from the same library, which contains an `InformationDisclosure` component and a `div` element. The `InformationDisclosure` component displays information about the farm, including the name, APR, and TVL. The `div` element contains the investment details and manage position tabs.

The `div` element contains a `toggleView` state variable, which determines whether the investment details or manage position tab is displayed. The `toggleView` variable is toggled when the user clicks the manage position or investment details button. If the investment details tab is selected, the `InvestmentDetails` component is rendered. If the manage position tab is selected, a `Tab.Group` component is rendered, which contains two `Tab` components and two `Tab.Panel` components. The `Tab` components display the text "Lending" or "Liquidity" depending on the type of pair, and "Staking". The `Tab.Panel` components contain the `ManageKashiPair` or `ManageSwapPair` component and the `ManageBar` component, respectively.

Overall, the `FarmListItemDetails` component is a reusable component that can be used to display information about a farm and allow the user to manage their position or view investment details. It uses several custom hooks and components to retrieve and display the necessary information.
