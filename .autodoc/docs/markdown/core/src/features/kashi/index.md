This code exports four modules from the `zoo` project: `Borrow`, `Repay`, `Deposit`, and `Withdraw`. These modules likely contain functionality related to managing financial transactions within the project. 

By exporting these modules, other parts of the `zoo` project can import and use them as needed. For example, if there is a component in the project that allows users to deposit funds into their account, it may import the `Deposit` module to handle the logic for processing the deposit. 

Here is an example of how these modules could be imported and used in another file within the `zoo` project:

```
import { Deposit, Withdraw } from './zoo'

const depositAmount = 100
const withdrawAmount = 50

// Deposit funds into user's account
const deposit = new Deposit(depositAmount)
deposit.process()

// Withdraw funds from user's account
const withdraw = new Withdraw(withdrawAmount)
withdraw.process()
```

In this example, the `Deposit` and `Withdraw` modules are imported from the `zoo` project and used to process a deposit and withdrawal transaction, respectively. 

Overall, this code serves as a way to organize and export the financial transaction functionality within the `zoo` project, making it easier to use and maintain throughout the project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code file?**\
A smart developer might wonder what the overall functionality of this code file is, and how it fits into the larger project. Based on the code, it appears to be exporting several modules related to borrowing, repaying, depositing, and withdrawing funds.

2. **What are the default exports being used?**\
A developer might want to know what specific modules are being exported as defaults from this file. Based on the code, it appears that the default exports are `Borrow`, `Repay`, `Deposit`, and `Withdraw`.

3. **Where are the modules being imported from?**\
A developer might be curious about where the modules being exported from this file are located. Based on the code, it appears that they are being imported from separate files located in the same `zoo` directory, named `Borrow.js`, `Repay.js`, `Deposit.js`, and `Withdraw.js`.
