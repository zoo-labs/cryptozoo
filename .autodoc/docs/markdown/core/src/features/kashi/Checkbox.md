This file contains code for three React components related to the zoo project. The first component is called `ExchangeRateCheckBox` and is used to display a checkbox that allows the user to update the exchange rate from an oracle. The component takes in several props including `color`, `pair`, `updateOracle`, `setUpdateOracle`, and `desiredDirection`. The component first checks if the current exchange rate is greater than zero, and if so, sets the `displayUpdateOracle` variable to the value of `updateOracle`. If the current exchange rate is zero, `displayUpdateOracle` is set to true. The `show` variable is then set based on whether `displayUpdateOracle` is true or if `desiredDirection` is 'up'. If either of these conditions is true, `show` is set to whether the oracle exchange rate is less than the current exchange rate. If neither condition is true, `show` is set to whether the oracle exchange rate is greater than the current exchange rate. Finally, if `show` is true, the component returns a div containing a `Checkbox` component, a text span, and a `QuestionHelper` component.

The second component is called `SwapCheckbox` and is used to display a checkbox that allows the user to swap tokens. The component takes in several props including `title`, `color`, `swap`, `setSwap`, `help`, and `trade`. The component uses the `useSwapSlippageTolerance` hook to get the allowed slippage for the trade. The component returns a div containing a `Checkbox` component, a text span, and a `QuestionHelper` component. If `swap` is true, the component also returns a `Settings` component with the `placeholderSlippage` prop set to the allowed slippage.

The third component is the default export and is simply the `Checkbox` component from the `../../components/Checkbox` file. This component is likely used throughout the zoo project to display checkboxes.

Overall, these components are used to display various checkboxes related to the zoo project, including updating the exchange rate from an oracle and swapping tokens. The `ExchangeRateCheckBox` component is likely used in conjunction with other components to display information about the current exchange rate and oracle exchange rate. The `SwapCheckbox` component is likely used in conjunction with other components to display information about swapping tokens and the allowed slippage.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ExchangeRateCheckBox` function and how is it used?
- The `ExchangeRateCheckBox` function takes in several props and returns a JSX element that displays a checkbox and some text. It is used to update the exchange rate from an oracle and increase the borrow limit.
2. What is the purpose of the `SwapCheckbox` function and how is it used?
- The `SwapCheckbox` function takes in several props and returns a JSX element that displays a checkbox and some text. It is used to enable or disable swapping and displays a settings component if swapping is enabled.
3. What is the purpose of the `useSwapSlippageTolerance` hook and how is it used?
- The `useSwapSlippageTolerance` hook takes in a `trade` object and returns a slippage tolerance value. It is used to calculate the maximum allowed slippage for a swap.
