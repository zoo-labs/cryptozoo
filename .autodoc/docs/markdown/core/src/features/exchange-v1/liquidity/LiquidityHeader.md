The `LiquidityHeader` function in this code file is responsible for rendering a header component that allows users to add or remove liquidity from a pool. The component takes two optional parameters, `input` and `output`, which are used to construct links for adding or removing liquidity for specific currency pairs. 

The function first imports several dependencies, including `NavLink` from a component directory, `React`, `currencyId` from a `functions` directory, and `useActiveWeb3React` from a `hooks` directory. 

The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to retrieve the current chain ID, which is used to construct the links for adding or removing liquidity. 

The function then returns a JSX element that renders a `div` with a `grid` layout and two `NavLink` components. The first `NavLink` component renders a link for adding liquidity, while the second `NavLink` component renders a link for removing liquidity. 

Both `NavLink` components use the `currencyId` function to construct the links based on the `input` and `output` parameters. The `Add` link is always rendered, while the `Remove` link is only rendered if an `output` parameter is provided. 

The `NavLink` components also include several CSS classes that are used to style the links based on their active state and whether or not they are currently being hovered over. 

Overall, this code file provides a reusable component that can be used to render a header for adding or removing liquidity from a pool. It takes optional parameters to customize the currency pairs for which liquidity can be added or removed, and it uses several dependencies to construct the links and style the component. 

Example usage:

```
<LiquidityHeader input="ETH" output="USDC" />
```

This would render a header component with links to add or remove liquidity for the ETH/USDC currency pair.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LiquidityHeader` function?
- The `LiquidityHeader` function is a React component that returns a JSX element representing a header for a liquidity section of a web application.

2. What is the significance of the `useActiveWeb3React` hook?
- The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to retrieve the current chain ID from the active Web3 provider, which is likely used to determine which blockchain network the liquidity operations will be performed on.

3. What is the expected behavior when the `output` parameter is not defined in the `LiquidityHeader` component?
- When the `output` parameter is not defined, the link associated with the "Remove" button will not be clickable, as defined by the `onClick` event handler.
