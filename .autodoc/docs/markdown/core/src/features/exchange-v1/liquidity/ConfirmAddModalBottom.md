The `ConfirmAddModalBottom` function is a React component that renders a modal dialog box for confirming the addition of liquidity to a pool in a decentralized exchange. The component takes several props, including `noLiquidity`, `price`, `currencies`, `parsedAmounts`, `poolTokenPercentage`, and `onAdd`. 

The `noLiquidity` prop is a boolean that indicates whether the pool being added to has any existing liquidity. The `price` prop is a `Fraction` object that represents the exchange rate between the two currencies being added to the pool. The `currencies` prop is an object that maps `Field` values to `Currency` objects, where `Field` is an enum representing the two currencies being added to the pool. The `parsedAmounts` prop is an object that maps `Field` values to `CurrencyAmount` objects, representing the amounts of each currency being added to the pool. The `poolTokenPercentage` prop is a `Percent` object representing the share of the pool being added to. Finally, the `onAdd` prop is a callback function that is called when the user confirms the addition of liquidity.

The component renders a dialog box with information about the exchange rate, the amounts of each currency being added, and the share of the pool being added to. It also renders a button that allows the user to confirm the addition of liquidity. The text of the button changes depending on whether the pool being added to has existing liquidity or not.

The component uses the `useLingui` hook from the `@lingui/react` package to provide internationalization support. It also uses the `Button` component from the `../../../components/Button` module.

Example usage:

```jsx
import { ConfirmAddModalBottom } from "@zoolabs/zdk-react";
import { Currency, CurrencyAmount, Fraction, Percent } from "@zoolabs/zdk";

function MyComponent() {
  const currencies = {
    [Field.CURRENCY_A]: new Currency("ETH", 18, "Ethereum"),
    [Field.CURRENCY_B]: new Currency("USDC", 6, "USD Coin"),
  };
  const parsedAmounts = {
    [Field.CURRENCY_A]: CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(currencies[Field.CURRENCY_A], "1"),
    [Field.CURRENCY_B]: CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount(currencies[Field.CURRENCY_B], "1000000"),
  };
  const price = new Fraction(1, 2000);
  const poolTokenPercentage = new Percent(50);
  const onAdd = () => {
    // handle addition of liquidity
  };
  return (
    <ConfirmAddModalBottom
      noLiquidity={false}
      price={price}
      currencies={currencies}
      parsedAmounts={parsedAmounts}
      poolTokenPercentage={poolTokenPercentage}
      onAdd={onAdd}
    />
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several dependencies including `@zoolabs/zdk`, `react`, and `@lingui/macro`.

2. What is the purpose of the `ConfirmAddModalBottom` function?
- The `ConfirmAddModalBottom` function appears to be a React component that renders a modal with information about currency rates, deposited amounts, and pool share percentage. It also includes a button to either create a new pool or confirm a supply.

3. What is the purpose of the `useLingui` hook?
- The `useLingui` hook is used to access the i18n functionality provided by the `@lingui/react` library, which allows for internationalization and localization of text in the application.
