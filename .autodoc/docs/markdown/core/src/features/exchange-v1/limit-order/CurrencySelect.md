The `CurrencySelect` component is a reusable React component that provides a UI for selecting a cryptocurrency token. It takes in several props, including the currently selected `currency`, the `otherCurrency` (if applicable), a boolean `showCommonBases` to determine whether to show common base currencies, a callback function `onSelect` to handle when a currency is selected, a `label` string to display above the currency selection UI, a list of `currencyList` strings to filter the available currencies, a boolean `includeNativeCurrency` to determine whether to include the native currency in the list of available currencies, and a boolean `allowManageTokenList` to determine whether to allow the user to manage the list of available tokens.

The component renders a button that displays the currently selected currency's logo and symbol, or a placeholder animation if no currency is selected. When the button is clicked, a modal is displayed that allows the user to search and select a new currency. The modal is only displayed if the `onSelect` prop is defined and the component is not disabled. The selected currency is passed to the `onSelect` callback function.

The component also uses the `useLingui` hook from the `@lingui/react` library to handle internationalization of the UI text. The `classNames` function from the `functions` module is used to conditionally apply CSS classes to the button element based on the currently selected currency.

Example usage:

```jsx
import { Currency } from "@zoolabs/zdk";
import CurrencySelect from "./CurrencySelect";

function MyComponent() {
  const [selectedCurrency, setSelectedCurrency] = useState<Currency | null>(null);

  const handleCurrencySelect = useCallback((currency: Currency) => {
    setSelectedCurrency(currency);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <CurrencySelect
        currency={selectedCurrency}
        onSelect={handleCurrencySelect}
        label="Select a token"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
