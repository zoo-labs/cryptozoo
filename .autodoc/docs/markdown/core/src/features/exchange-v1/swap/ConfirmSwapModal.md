[View code on GitHub](zoo-labs/zoo/blob/master/core/src/features/exchange-v1/swap/ConfirmSwapModal.tsx)

This code defines a React component called `ConfirmSwapModal` that renders a modal for confirming a token swap. The modal displays details of the swap, such as the input and output amounts, and allows the user to confirm or cancel the swap. 

The component takes several props, including `trade`, which is a V2Trade object representing the swap, and `allowedSlippage`, which is a percentage representing the maximum allowed price slippage for the swap. The component also takes callback functions for accepting changes to the swap, confirming the swap, and dismissing the modal.

The `ConfirmSwapModal` component uses two other components, `SwapModalHeader` and `SwapModalFooter`, to render the header and footer of the modal, respectively. These components display additional details about the swap, such as the recipient address and miner bribe amount.

The `ConfirmSwapModal` component also defines a function called `tradeMeaningfullyDiffers` that compares two V2Trade objects and returns true if they differ in a meaningful way. This function is used to determine whether to display a button for accepting changes to the swap.

Overall, this code provides a user interface for confirming a token swap and displays relevant details about the swap. It can be used as part of a larger project that involves token trading or swapping. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import ConfirmSwapModal from './ConfirmSwapModal';

function MyComponent() {
  const [isOpen, setIsOpen] = useState(false);
  const [trade, setTrade] = useState(null);

  const handleConfirm = () => {
    // handle swap confirmation
  };

  const handleDismiss = () => {
    setIsOpen(false);
  };

  const handleSwap = () => {
    // create trade object
    const trade = new V2Trade(...);
    setTrade(trade);
    setIsOpen(true);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={handleSwap}>Swap tokens</button>
      <ConfirmSwapModal
        isOpen={isOpen}
        trade={trade}
        allowedSlippage={new Percent(1)}
        onConfirm={handleConfirm}
        onDismiss={handleDismiss}
      />
    </>
  );
}
```
