The `Pagination` component is a reusable React component that generates a pagination control for a list of items. It takes in four props: `currentPage`, `onChange`, `totalPages`, and `pageNeighbours`. 

The `currentPage` prop is the current page number, `onChange` is a callback function that is called when a page is clicked, `totalPages` is the total number of pages, and `pageNeighbours` is the number of pages to show on either side of the current page.

The component generates a list of page numbers based on the `totalPages` and `pageNeighbours` props. It then renders a list of buttons, with the current page highlighted, and "Previous" and "Next" buttons on either end of the list. If there are more pages than can be displayed, the component will add ellipses to indicate that there are more pages available.

The `range` function is a helper function that generates an array of numbers between two given numbers. It takes in three arguments: `from`, `to`, and `step`. It returns an array of numbers between `from` and `to`, incremented by `step`.

The `Pagination` component uses the `range` function to generate the list of page numbers. It then uses the `reduce` method to generate an array of buttons for each page number. The buttons are wrapped in an array, with the "Previous" and "Next" buttons in their own arrays. The `reduce` method returns an array of three arrays: one for the "Previous" buttons, one for the page buttons, and one for the "Next" buttons.

The `classNames` function is a utility function that generates a string of class names based on the arguments passed to it. It is used to generate the class names for the buttons.

The `Pagination` component returns a `nav` element containing the list of buttons. If there is only one page, the component returns an empty fragment.

Example usage:

```jsx
<Pagination
  currentPage={2}
  onChange={(page) => console.log(`Go to page ${page}`)}
  totalPages={10}
  pageNeighbours={2}
/>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code exports a React component called `Pagination` that takes in props for the current page, total number of pages, and a function to handle page changes. It generates a pagination UI with buttons to navigate to different pages.

2. What is the purpose of the `getPageNumbers` function?
- The `getPageNumbers` function calculates which page numbers to display in the pagination UI based on the current page, total number of pages, and the number of page neighbors to show on each side of the current page. It returns an array of page numbers to display.

3. What is the purpose of the `LEFT_PAGE` and `RIGHT_PAGE` constants?
- The `LEFT_PAGE` and `RIGHT_PAGE` constants are used to represent the left and right arrow buttons in the pagination UI. They are used in the `getPageNumbers` function to add these buttons to the array of page numbers to display.
