This code exports all the functions and variables from two different files located in the `zoo` project: `hooks.js` and `fetchers.js`. 

The purpose of this code is to make all the functionality from these two files available to other parts of the `zoo` project without having to import each function or variable individually. This can save time and make the code more readable by reducing the number of import statements needed.

For example, if another file in the `zoo` project needs to use a function from `hooks.js`, it can simply import everything from this file using the following code:

```
import * as hooks from './hooks'
```

This will import all the functions and variables from `hooks.js` and make them available under the `hooks` namespace. The same can be done for `fetchers.js`:

```
import * as fetchers from './fetchers'
```

Overall, this code helps to simplify the process of importing and using functions and variables from multiple files within the `zoo` project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this file?** 
A smart developer might wonder what the overall purpose of this file is within the `zoo` project. Based on the code, it appears to be exporting functionality from two other files, but it's unclear what those files contain or how they relate to the rest of the project.

2. **What are the `hooks` and `fetchers` modules?** 
A smart developer might want to know more about the `hooks` and `fetchers` modules being exported from this file. What functionality do they provide? Are they related to each other in any way? Understanding these modules could help the developer better understand the overall architecture of the `zoo` project.

3. **Why is everything being exported?** 
A smart developer might question why everything is being exported from this file using the `export *` syntax. Is this necessary for the project to function properly? Are there any potential downsides to exporting everything in this way? Understanding the reasoning behind this design decision could help the developer make informed decisions about their own code.
