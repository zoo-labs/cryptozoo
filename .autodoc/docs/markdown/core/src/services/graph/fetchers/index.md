The code in this file provides a function called `pager` that is used to make paginated requests to a GraphQL endpoint. The function takes three arguments: `endpoint`, which is the URL of the GraphQL endpoint to query; `query`, which is the GraphQL query to execute; and `variables`, which is an optional object containing any variables needed for the query.

The `pager` function first checks if the `endpoint` argument contains the string "undefined". If it does, the function returns an empty object. Otherwise, the function initializes an empty object called `data`, a variable called `skip` set to 0, and a boolean flag set to `true`.

The function then enters a `while` loop that will continue to execute as long as the `flag` variable is `true`. Inside the loop, the function makes a GraphQL request to the `endpoint` using the `request` function from the `graphql-request` library. The response from the request is stored in a variable called `req`.

The function then iterates over the keys of the `req` object using `Object.keys()` and for each key, it checks if the key already exists in the `data` object. If it does, the function concatenates the new data with the existing data using the spread operator (`...`). If it doesn't, the function simply adds the new data to the `data` object.

The function then iterates over the values of the `req` object using `Object.values()` and for each value, it checks if the length of the value is equal to 1000. If it is, the function sets the `flag` variable to `true`, which will cause the `while` loop to continue executing.

If the `variables` object passed to the function contains a key called "first", the function breaks out of the `while` loop. Otherwise, the function increments the `skip` variable by 1000 and updates the `variables` object to include the new `skip` value.

Once the `while` loop has completed, the function returns the `data` object.

In addition to the `pager` function, this file also exports several other modules (`blocks`, `exchange`, `masterchef`, and `status`) using the `export * from` syntax. These modules likely contain additional functions or classes that are used elsewhere in the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `pager` function?
   - The `pager` function is used to make paginated requests to a GraphQL endpoint and return the combined data from all pages.
2. What is the significance of checking if the `endpoint` includes the string `'undefined'`?
   - If the `endpoint` includes the string `'undefined'`, the function returns an empty object. This is likely a safeguard against making requests to an invalid or non-existent endpoint.
3. What are the other files being exported from this module?
   - In addition to the `pager` function, this module also exports functions from four other files: `blocks`, `exchange`, `masterchef`, and `status`. It is unclear what these functions do without further context.
