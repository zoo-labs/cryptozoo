This code is a module that exports a single function called `status`. The purpose of this function is to query the indexing status of a subgraph on a specified chain in the Zoo project. 

The function takes two arguments: `chainId` and `subgraphName`. `chainId` is an optional argument that defaults to `ChainId.MAINNET`, which is an enum value from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library. `subgraphName` is a required argument that specifies the name of the subgraph to query.

The function uses the `request` function from the `graphql-request` library to send a GraphQL query to the Zoo project's indexing server. The query is a string that contains a GraphQL query that requests the indexing status for the specified subgraph on the specified chain. The query includes fields for the subgraph's sync status, health, fatal error (if any), and block information for the chain's head and latest blocks.

The function returns a Promise that resolves to an object containing the indexing status information for the specified subgraph on the specified chain. The object has the following properties:

- `synced`: a boolean value indicating whether the subgraph is fully synced on the specified chain
- `health`: a string value indicating the health status of the subgraph on the specified chain
- `fatalError`: an object containing information about any fatal errors that have occurred during indexing, including an error message, block number and hash, and handler information
- `chains`: an array of objects containing information about the chain(s) being queried, including the chain's head block number and the latest block number

This function can be used by other modules in the Zoo project to check the indexing status of a subgraph on a specified chain. For example, a monitoring module could use this function to periodically check the indexing status of all subgraphs on all chains and alert the development team if any subgraphs are not fully synced or have encountered fatal errors. 

Example usage:

```
import { status } from 'zoo'

// Get the indexing status for the "my-subgraph" subgraph on the Rinkeby testnet
const subgraphStatus = await status(ChainId.RINKEBY, 'my-subgraph')
console.log(subgraphStatus)
// Output: { synced: true, health: 'healthy', fatalError: null, chains: [{ chainHeadBlock: { number: 12345 }, latestBlock: { number: 12346 } }] }
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is used to retrieve the indexing status of a subgraph on a specified chain.

2. What is the significance of the `ChainId` and `GRAPH_HOST` constants?
- `ChainId` is an enum that represents the different Ethereum networks (e.g. Mainnet, Rinkeby). `GRAPH_HOST` is a constant that holds the URL of the Graph Node API endpoint.
- These constants are used to construct the URL for the GraphQL request based on the specified chain.

3. What information is returned by the `status` function?
- The `status` function returns an object that contains information about the indexing status of the specified subgraph on the specified chain, including whether it is synced, its health, any fatal errors, and information about the chain's latest blocks.
