This code defines a set of functions that interact with The Graph, a decentralized indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. The functions are used to retrieve information about blocks on various chains, including Ethereum, xDai, Polygon, Fantom, BSC, Harmony, Avalanche, Celo, Arbitrum, OKExChain, and Heco. 

The `BLOCKS` object maps each chain ID to a subgraph name on The Graph that contains information about blocks on that chain. The `fetcher` function takes a chain ID, a GraphQL query, and optional variables, and returns the result of the query from the corresponding subgraph. 

The `getBlock` function takes a chain ID and a Unix timestamp, and returns the block number of the block that was mined closest to that timestamp. It does this by querying the subgraph for blocks with timestamps between `timestamp - 600` and `timestamp`, and returning the number of the first block in the result set. 

The `getBlocks` function takes a chain ID, a start timestamp, and an end timestamp, and returns an array of blocks mined between those timestamps. It does this by querying the subgraph for blocks with timestamps between `start` and `end`. 

The `getMassBlocks` function takes a chain ID and an array of Unix timestamps, and returns an array of objects containing the block number and timestamp of the block that was mined closest to each timestamp in the input array. It does this by constructing a GraphQL query that retrieves the block with the closest timestamp to each input timestamp, and returning the result set as an array of objects. 

The `getAverageBlockTime` function takes a chain ID and returns the average time between blocks over the past 6 hours. It does this by calling `getBlocks` with a start time of 6 hours ago and an end time of the current time, and then calculating the average time between blocks in the result set. 

These functions are used to retrieve information about blocks on various chains, which can be used for a variety of purposes such as calculating transaction fees, estimating confirmation times, and monitoring network health. For example, `getBlock` could be used to estimate the block number of a transaction that was mined at a specific time, while `getAverageBlockTime` could be used to monitor the health of a network by detecting changes in block times.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `fetcher` function?
- The `fetcher` function is used to make a GraphQL request to a subgraph for a specific chain ID and block data.

2. What is the purpose of the `getBlock` function?
- The `getBlock` function is used to retrieve the block number for a specific chain ID and timestamp.

3. What is the purpose of the `getAverageBlockTime` function?
- The `getAverageBlockTime` function is used to calculate the average time difference between a sample of blocks for a specific chain ID.
