This code defines GraphQL queries for retrieving information about blocks in a blockchain. The `blockFieldsQuery` defines a fragment that specifies the fields to be returned for a block, including its `id`, `number`, and `timestamp`. 

The `blockQuery` is a GraphQL query that retrieves the most recent block that matches a given filter. It takes a filter object as an argument and returns the first block that matches the filter, sorted by timestamp in descending order. The query includes the `blockFields` fragment to specify the fields to be returned for the block. 

The `blocksQuery` is a GraphQL query that retrieves a list of blocks that match a given time range. It takes four arguments: `first` (the number of blocks to return), `skip` (the number of blocks to skip), `start` (the start of the time range), and `end` (the end of the time range). The query returns the blocks sorted by block number in descending order and includes the `blockFields` fragment to specify the fields to be returned for each block. 

The `massBlocksQuery` is a function that takes an array of timestamps and returns a GraphQL query that retrieves the first block after each timestamp. The query includes a separate block query for each timestamp, with the query name being the timestamp value. The query includes the `blockFields` fragment to specify the fields to be returned for each block. 

These queries can be used to retrieve information about blocks in a blockchain, such as their number, timestamp, and other metadata. The `blockQuery` can be used to retrieve the most recent block that matches a given filter, while the `blocksQuery` can be used to retrieve a list of blocks that match a given time range. The `massBlocksQuery` can be used to retrieve the first block after a list of timestamps, which can be useful for tracking the progress of the blockchain over time. 

Example usage:

```
import { blockQuery, blocksQuery, massBlocksQuery } from 'zoo'

// Retrieve the most recent block
const latestBlock = await client.query({
  query: blockQuery,
  variables: { where: { number_gt: 0 } }
})

// Retrieve the blocks in a given time range
const blocksInRange = await client.query({
  query: blocksQuery,
  variables: { first: 100, skip: 0, start: 1609459200, end: 1609545600 }
})

// Retrieve the first block after a list of timestamps
const timestamps = [1609459200, 1609462800, 1609466400]
const massBlocks = await client.query({
  query: massBlocksQuery(timestamps)
})
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `blockFieldsQuery` fragment?
- The `blockFieldsQuery` fragment defines the fields that should be returned for a `Block` object.

2. What is the difference between `blockQuery` and `blocksQuery`?
- `blockQuery` returns the most recent `Block` object that matches the specified filter, while `blocksQuery` returns a list of `Block` objects that match the specified filter.

3. What is the purpose of the `massBlocksQuery` function?
- The `massBlocksQuery` function generates a GraphQL query that returns the first `Block` object that matches a list of timestamps, sorted in ascending order by timestamp.
