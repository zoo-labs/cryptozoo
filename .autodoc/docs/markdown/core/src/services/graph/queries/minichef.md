The code above contains two GraphQL queries that are used to retrieve data related to pools in the larger project. The first query is called `miniChefPoolsQuery` and it retrieves information about the pools, such as their ID, pair, rewarder, allocation point, last reward time, accumulated Sushi per share, SLP balance, user count, and mini chef. The query takes in several variables, such as `first`, `skip`, `orderBy`, `orderDirection`, `block`, and `where`, which can be used to filter and sort the results. For example, `first` and `skip` can be used to paginate the results, while `orderBy` and `orderDirection` can be used to sort the results by a specific field and direction. The `where` variable is used to filter the results based on certain conditions, such as `allocPoint_gt` and `accSushiPerShare_gt`, which filter out pools with an allocation point or accumulated Sushi per share less than or equal to zero. The query is exported as a constant, which can be imported and used in other parts of the project.

The second query is called `miniChefPairAddressesQuery` and it retrieves information about the pair addresses associated with the pools. The query takes in similar variables as the first query, such as `first`, `skip`, `orderBy`, `orderDirection`, and `where`, which can be used to filter and sort the results. The query retrieves the ID, allocation point, accumulated Sushi per share, and pair ID for each pool. The query is also exported as a constant, which can be imported and used in other parts of the project.

Overall, these queries are used to retrieve data related to pools in the larger project, which can be used for various purposes, such as displaying the data on a dashboard or calculating rewards for users. The queries are written in GraphQL, which is a query language for APIs that allows for efficient and flexible data retrieval. The queries take in variables that can be used to customize the results, making them more versatile and reusable.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `miniChefPoolsQuery` and `miniChefPairAddressesQuery` functions?
   
   `miniChefPoolsQuery` and `miniChefPairAddressesQuery` are GraphQL queries that retrieve data from the `pools` table. The former retrieves more detailed information about each pool, while the latter only retrieves the pool ID and the ID of its associated pair.

2. What are the default values for the variables used in these queries?
   
   The default values for the variables used in both queries are as follows: `first` is 1000, `skip` is 0, `orderBy` is "id", `orderDirection` is "desc", and `where` is a filter object that specifies that the `allocPoint` and `accSushiPerShare` fields must be greater than 0.

3. What is the purpose of the `Pool_filter` type used in the `miniChefPoolsQuery` and `miniChefPairAddressesQuery` functions?
   
   `Pool_filter` is a custom input type that is used to filter the `pools` table based on certain criteria. In this case, it is used to filter pools where the `allocPoint` and `accSushiPerShare` fields are greater than 0.
