This file contains a set of GraphQL queries that can be used to retrieve data from the Uniswap V2 subgraph. The queries are organized into sections based on the type of data they retrieve, such as pairs, tokens, and transactions.

The `factoryQuery` retrieves data about the Uniswap factory contract, such as the total volume and liquidity in USD. The `userIdsQuery` retrieves a list of user IDs. The `uniswapUserQuery` retrieves data about a specific user, including their liquidity positions. The `ethPriceQuery` retrieves the current ETH price. The `tokenPriceQuery` retrieves the price of a specific token in ETH.

The `dayDatasQuery` retrieves daily data for Uniswap pairs, such as volume and liquidity. The `pairQuery` retrieves data about a specific pair, including its reserves and volume. The `pairIdsQuery` retrieves a list of pair IDs. The `pairCountQuery` retrieves the total number of pairs in the Uniswap factory. The `pairDayDatasQuery` retrieves daily data for a set of pairs.

The `liquidityPositionsQuery` retrieves data about liquidity positions, including the user and pair IDs. The `pairsQuery` retrieves data about pairs, including their reserves and volume. The `pairsTimeTravelQuery` retrieves historical data for a set of pairs.

The `tokenQuery` retrieves data about a specific token, including its symbol, name, and liquidity. The `tokenIdsQuery` retrieves a list of token IDs. The `tokenDayDatasQuery` retrieves daily data for a set of tokens. The `tokenPairsQuery` retrieves pairs that include a specific token. The `tokensQuery` retrieves data about tokens, including their volume and price.

The `transactionsQuery` retrieves data about swaps, mints, and burns.

These queries can be used to retrieve data from the Uniswap V2 subgraph for analysis and visualization. For example, the `dayDatasQuery` can be used to create a chart of daily volume and liquidity for a specific pair. The `tokensQuery` can be used to create a list of the top tokens by volume. The `transactionsQuery` can be used to analyze trading activity on Uniswap.
