This code defines a constant object GRAPH_HOST that maps each ChainId to a corresponding URL for a blockchain data indexing service. The ChainId values are imported from the '@zoolabs/zdk' library. The URLs are for various blockchain networks, including Ethereum mainnet, xDai, Matic, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain, Avalanche, Celo, Arbitrum, Harmony, OKExChain, and Heco. 

This code is likely used in the larger project to provide a centralized location for accessing blockchain data indexing services across multiple networks. By defining the URLs in this object, the project can easily switch between different indexing services or add support for new networks by simply updating the object. 

For example, if the project wanted to add support for a new network called "MyChain", they could simply add a new key-value pair to the GRAPH_HOST object like so:

```
const MYCHAIN_GRAPH = 'https://api.mychain.com'
export const GRAPH_HOST = {
  [ChainId.MAINNET]: THE_GRAPH,
  [ChainId.XDAI]: THE_GRAPH,
  [ChainId.MATIC]: THE_GRAPH,
  [ChainId.FANTOM]: THE_GRAPH,
  [ChainId.BSC]: THE_GRAPH,
  [ChainId.AVALANCHE]: THE_GRAPH,
  [ChainId.CELO]: THE_GRAPH,
  [ChainId.ARBITRUM]: THE_GRAPH,
  [ChainId.HARMONY]: 'https://sushi.graph.t.hmny.io',
  [ChainId.OKEX]: HYPER_GRAPH,
  [ChainId.HECO]: HYPER_GRAPH,
  [ChainId.MYCHAIN]: MYCHAIN_GRAPH,
}
```

Then, any code in the project that references GRAPH_HOST using the ChainId for "MyChain" would automatically use the new URL. 

Overall, this code provides a convenient way for the project to access blockchain data indexing services across multiple networks without having to hardcode URLs throughout the codebase.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChainId` import from `@zoolabs/zdk`?
   - The `ChainId` import is likely used to define different blockchain networks within the `GRAPH_HOST` object.
2. What are the different values assigned to `GRAPH_HOST` for each `ChainId`?
   - The different values assigned to `GRAPH_HOST` correspond to different blockchain networks, including MAINNET, XDAI, MATIC, FANTOM, BSC, AVALANCHE, CELO, ARBITRUM, HARMONY, OKEX, and HECO.
3. What are the different URLs assigned to `THE_GRAPH`, `NAS_GRAPH`, and `HYPER_GRAPH`?
   - `THE_GRAPH` is assigned the URL `https://api.thegraph.com`, `NAS_GRAPH` is assigned the URL `https://graph.kkt.one/node`, and `HYPER_GRAPH` is assigned the URL `https://q.hg.network`.
