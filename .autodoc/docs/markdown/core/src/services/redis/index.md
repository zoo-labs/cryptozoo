This code imports the Redis library from the 'ioredis' package and creates a new Redis client instance using the URL specified in the environment variable 'REDIS_URL'. The Redis client instance is then exported as the default export of this module.

Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. This code allows other modules in the 'zoo' project to use the Redis client instance to store and retrieve data from Redis.

For example, if a module in the 'zoo' project needs to store user session data, it can import the Redis client instance from this module and use the set() method to store the session data with a unique key:

```
import redis from './redis'

const sessionId = 'abc123'
const sessionData = { userId: 123, isLoggedIn: true }

redis.set(sessionId, JSON.stringify(sessionData))
```

Later, the module can retrieve the session data using the get() method:

```
const sessionDataString = await redis.get(sessionId)
const sessionData = JSON.parse(sessionDataString)
``` 

Overall, this code provides a simple and efficient way for modules in the 'zoo' project to use Redis as a data store.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of this code?**\
A smart developer might wonder what this code does and how it fits into the overall functionality of the `zoo` project. Based on the code, it appears to be importing the Redis library and creating a new Redis instance using the `REDIS_URL` environment variable, and then exporting that instance.

2. **What is the Redis library and why is it being used in this project?**\
A smart developer might be familiar with Redis but may not know why it is being used in this specific project. Redis is an in-memory data structure store that can be used as a database, cache, and message broker. It's possible that this project is using Redis for one or more of these purposes.

3. **What is the significance of exporting the Redis instance?**\
A smart developer might wonder why the Redis instance is being exported. Exporting the instance makes it available for use in other parts of the `zoo` project. This could be useful if other modules or files need to interact with Redis or if the Redis instance needs to be shared across multiple parts of the project.
