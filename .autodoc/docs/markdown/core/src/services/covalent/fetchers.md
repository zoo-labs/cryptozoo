This code provides a set of functions for interacting with the Covalent API, which is a blockchain data platform. The functions are designed to retrieve various types of data from the API, such as token balances, portfolio information, transfers, blocks, logs, NFT metadata, and more. 

Each function takes in a chain ID and an address (or other relevant parameters) as input, and returns a Promise that resolves to the requested data. The default chain ID is set to MAINNET, but can be overridden if needed. 

For example, the `getTokenBalances` function retrieves the token balances for a given address on a specified chain. Here's an example usage:

```
import { getTokenBalances } from 'zoo'

const address = '0x123abc...'
const chainId = 1 // Ethereum mainnet

getTokenBalances(chainId, address)
  .then((balances) => {
    console.log(balances)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
  })
```

This would log an array of token balances for the specified address on the Ethereum mainnet. 

Note that there is also a `getSushiSwapLiquidityTransactions` function that is currently marked as a TODO. This function is designed to retrieve liquidity transactions for the SushiSwap decentralized exchange. It takes in a chain ID and an address as input, and returns a Promise that resolves to the requested data. 

Overall, these functions provide a convenient way to retrieve blockchain data from the Covalent API, and can be used to power various features within a larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code provides functions for fetching data from the Covalent API for various blockchain-related data such as token balances, transactions, and NFT metadata.

2. What is the format of the data returned by the fetcher function?
- The fetcher function returns a Promise that resolves to the JSON data returned by the Covalent API.

3. What is the purpose of the TODO comment for CLASS B?
- The TODO comment indicates that there is a planned addition of a function for fetching SushiSwap liquidity transactions, but it has not yet been implemented.
