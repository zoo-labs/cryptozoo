This code exports all the functions and variables from two separate files located in the `zoo` project: `hooks.js` and `fetchers.js`. 

The purpose of this code is to make all the functionality from these two files available to other parts of the project without having to import each function or variable individually. This can save time and make the code more readable by reducing the number of import statements needed.

For example, if another file in the `zoo` project needs to use a function from `hooks.js`, it can simply import it like this:

```
import { useAnimal } from './zoo'
```

This will import the `useAnimal` function from `hooks.js` and make it available for use in the importing file.

Similarly, if a function from `fetchers.js` is needed, it can be imported in the same way:

```
import { getAnimalData } from './zoo'
```

Overall, this code helps to streamline the process of importing and using functions and variables from other files in the `zoo` project.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `hooks` and `fetchers` files?**\
A smart developer might wonder what functionality is contained within these files and how they are used within the `zoo` project.

2. **Are there any dependencies or requirements for using these exports?**\
A smart developer might want to know if there are any specific versions of dependencies or other requirements needed to use the exported functions from these files.

3. **Is there any documentation or examples available for using these exports?**\
A smart developer might want to know if there is any additional documentation or examples available for using the exported functions from these files, in order to better understand how to integrate them into their own code.
