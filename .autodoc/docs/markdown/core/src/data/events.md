This code is a JSON file containing information about upcoming events related to the zoo project. The file contains an array of objects, with each object representing a single event. Each event object has several properties, including an ID, title, description, date, time, and location.

The purpose of this code is to provide a centralized location for storing and accessing information about upcoming events related to the zoo project. This information can be used by developers, project managers, and other stakeholders to plan and coordinate their work around these events.

For example, a developer working on a feature related to NFT Animals may want to know when the next Animal Party is scheduled so they can coordinate their work around that event. They can access this information from the JSON file and plan accordingly.

Similarly, a project manager may want to use this information to plan marketing campaigns around these events or to ensure that key stakeholders are available to attend important meetings or presentations.

Overall, this code serves as a valuable resource for anyone involved in the zoo project, providing a centralized location for important event information that can be easily accessed and used to plan and coordinate work.
