The `ZooFooter` component is a React component that renders the footer section of a website. It imports several modules, including `React`, `useEffect`, `useState`, `Link`, `axios`, and `Image`. The component defines a state object `Form` that has an `email` property and two other state variables `success` and `error`. The `Form` state object is updated when the user types in their email address in the input field. The `handleSubmit` function is called when the user clicks the submit button. It sends a POST request to the `/api/subscribe` endpoint with the email address entered by the user. If the request is successful, the `Form` state object is updated with a success message, and the `success` state variable is set to `true`. If the request fails, the `Form` state object is updated with an error message, and the `error` state variable is set to `true`.

The `ZooFooter` component renders a section with the id `faqs`. It contains a logo, a grid with three columns, and a social media section. The first column contains links to the marketplace, chart, community, press, and learn pages. The second column contains links to the user's profile, connect wallet, whitepaper, FAQ, and contact us pages. The third column contains a newsletter subscription form. The form has an input field for the user's email address and a submit button. When the user submits the form, the `handleSubmit` function is called, and the email address is sent to the server. If the request is successful, a success message is displayed, and if it fails, an error message is displayed.

The `CustomLink` and `CustomIconLink` components are used to render links and icons in the footer. The `CustomLink` component takes two props, `link` and `title`, and renders a link to the specified `link` with the specified `title`. The `CustomIconLink` component takes two props, `link` and `icon`, and renders an icon that links to the specified `link`.

Overall, the `ZooFooter` component provides a way for users to subscribe to a newsletter and navigate to different pages of the website. It also displays social media links and copyright information.
