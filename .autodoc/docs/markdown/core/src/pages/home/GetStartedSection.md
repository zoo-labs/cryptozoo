The `GetStartedSection` component is a React functional component that renders a section of the Zoo project's landing page. The section contains a heading, a paragraph, and a button that links to the project's blog page. Additionally, the section displays an image of a hippopotamus.

The component imports the `React` and `useEffect` modules from the `react` package and the `Image` component from the `next/image` package. The `fadeInFromLeft` and `fadeInFromRight` functions are imported from the `animation` module located in the `../../animation` directory.

The `GetStartedSection` component returns a JSX element that represents the section. The section has a class name of `GetStarted` and an ID of `about`. The section contains a `div` element with a class name of `px-6 pb-20 mx-auto max-w-7xl lg:flex lg:items-center lg:justify-between`. This `div` element contains two child `div` elements.

The first child `div` element contains the heading, paragraph, and button. The heading is a `h1` element with a class name of `mb-6 text-3xl font-bold md:text-4xl lg:text-[44px] leading-[3rem] lg:leading-4` and the text "Make yield and do good." The paragraph is a `p` element with a class name of `mb-6 text-base text-white lg:text-lg lg:mb-8 text-opacity-70 md:max-w-2xl` and the text "ZOO is a DeFi game that allows players to collect NFT animals representative of endangered species in the real world. Based on your game interactions users make more or less $ZOO." The button is an `a` element with a class name of `px-5 py-3 text-sm text-white rounded-full  font-semibold bg-gradient-to-b from-purple to-blue md:text-base md:px-6 md:py-4 lg:px-10` and the text "Get Started". The `href` attribute of the button is set to "/blog".

The second child `div` element contains the image of the hippopotamus. The image is an `Image` component with a `src` attribute that points to an image of a hippopotamus, a `width` of 603 pixels, a `height` of 450 pixels, and an empty `alt` attribute.

The `GetStartedSection` component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the Zoo project. For example, it could be imported into the `HomePage` component and rendered as part of the landing page.
