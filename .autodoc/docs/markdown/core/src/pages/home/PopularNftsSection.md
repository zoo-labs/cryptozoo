The `PopularNftsSection` component is a React component that renders a section of the Zoo project's website that displays popular NFTs (non-fungible tokens) available for purchase on the marketplace. The component imports the `React` and `useEffect` modules from the `react` package, as well as the `Image` component from the `next/image` package, and the `NftCard` component from a local file. The component also imports two animation functions, `fadeInOnScroll` and `fadeInOnScrollAndStagger`, from a local `animation` module.

The `PopularNftsSection` component returns a JSX element that contains a `section` element with a `div` element inside of it. The `div` element has a `className` of `max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 lg:pb-20`, which sets the maximum width of the element to 7xl, centers it horizontally, and adds padding to the bottom of the element on large screens. Inside the `div` element, there is another `div` element with a `className` of `flex flex-col items-center`, which centers its child elements vertically and horizontally. The `div` element contains an `h1` element with a `className` of `text-2xl md:text-2xl lg:text-[44px] leading-[3rem] lg:leading-4 text-center mb-4 font-semibold`, which sets the font size and weight of the text, centers it horizontally, and adds some margin to the bottom of the element. The `h1` element contains the text "Popular NFTs". Below the `h1` element, there is a `p` element with a `className` of `text-base lg:text-lg mb-6 lg:mb-8 text-white text-center text-opacity-70 md:max-w-xl`, which sets the font size, color, and opacity of the text, centers it horizontally, and adds some margin to the bottom of the element. The `p` element contains the text "Browse and bid on the hottest ZOO NFTs on the marketplace.".

Below the `div` element with the `h1` and `p` elements, there is another `div` element with a `className` of `flex flex-col items-center lg:flex-row lg: justify-between lg:gap-4`. This `div` element contains four instances of the `NftCard` component, each with different props passed to it. The `NftCard` component takes an `image` prop, which is an `Image` component with a `src`, `width`, `height`, and `alt` prop passed to it. The `NftCard` component also takes a `name`, `price`, `address`, `days`, `highestBid`, and `yields` prop, which are used to display information about the NFT. The `NftCard` component is defined in a separate file and is not included in this code snippet.

The `PopularNftsSection` component also includes two commented-out `useEffect` hooks that call the `fadeInOnScroll` and `fadeInOnScrollAndStagger` animation functions. These hooks are not currently being used in the component, but they could be used to animate the display of the NFTs when they come into view on the page.

Overall, the `PopularNftsSection` component is a reusable component that can be used to display popular NFTs on any page of the Zoo project's website. The component is flexible and can be easily customized by passing different props to the `NftCard` component.
