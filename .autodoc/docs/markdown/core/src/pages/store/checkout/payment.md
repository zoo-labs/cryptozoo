The `Shipping` component is responsible for rendering the shipping and payment information for the zoo project. It is a functional component that returns a JSX element. 

The component is divided into two sections: the shipping section and the payment section. The shipping section displays the contact information, shipping address, and shipping method. Each section has a "Change" button that allows the user to modify the information. 

The payment section displays a list of payment options. Each payment option is represented by an image and a radio button. The user can select one of the payment options to proceed with the payment. 

At the bottom of the payment section, there is a "Pay Now" button that the user can click to complete the payment process. 

This component can be used in the larger project by importing it and rendering it in a parent component that handles the overall checkout process. For example, the `Shipping` component can be rendered in a `Checkout` component that also handles the cart items and the total amount. 

Here is an example of how the `Shipping` component can be used in a `Checkout` component:

```
import Shipping from './Shipping';

const Checkout = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Render cart items and total amount */}
      <Shipping />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Checkout;
```

Overall, the `Shipping` component provides a user-friendly interface for the shipping and payment information in the zoo project.
