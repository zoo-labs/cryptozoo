The `ProductsSection` component is a React component that renders a section of the Zoo Store website that displays a list of products. The component imports the `useState` and `useAppSelector` hooks from the `react` and `state/hooks` modules respectively, and the `Product` type from the `types/product` module. 

The `ProductInterface` interface defines the shape of a product object, which has properties such as `name`, `price`, `description`, `properties`, `image`, `gallery_image`, `quantity`, `_id`, and `status`. The `properties` property is an object that contains arrays of strings representing the available colors, sizes, and adendums for the product.

The `ProductsSection` component uses the `useAppSelector` hook to retrieve the `Products` array from the store state. If the `Products` array is not empty, the component maps over the array and renders a product card for each product. Each product card contains an image, name, short description, and base price. If the `Products` array is empty, the component displays a message indicating that there are no products.

The component is exported as the default export of the module, which means that it can be imported and used in other parts of the Zoo Store website. For example, the component could be imported and rendered in the `Home` component to display the list of products on the home page of the website.

Example usage:

```
import ProductsSection from 'zoo/ProductsSection';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo Store</h1>
      <ProductsSection />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```
