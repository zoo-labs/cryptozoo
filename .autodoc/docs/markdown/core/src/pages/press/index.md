The code above is a React component that renders a "Coming Soon" message. The component is imported from a file located at "components/ComingSoon". The purpose of this code is to provide a placeholder for a future feature or section of the website that is currently under development. 

This component is likely to be used in the larger project as a way to inform users that a particular section of the website is not yet available. For example, if the website is a zoo website, this component may be used to indicate that a new exhibit or feature is coming soon. 

The code is relatively simple. It defines a functional component called "Press" that returns a div containing the "ComingSoon" component. The "ComingSoon" component is likely to be a simple message or graphic that indicates that the feature is not yet available. 

Here is an example of how this component might be used in a larger project:

```
import Press from "components/Press";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to the Zoo Website</h1>
      <Press />
      <p>Check back soon for updates!</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

In this example, the "Press" component is used to indicate that a particular section of the website is not yet available. The message is displayed between the heading and the paragraph, providing a clear indication to the user that the website is still under development. 

Overall, this code provides a simple and effective way to indicate that a particular feature or section of the website is not yet available. It is likely to be used in a larger project as a way to manage user expectations and provide a clear indication of what is coming soon.
