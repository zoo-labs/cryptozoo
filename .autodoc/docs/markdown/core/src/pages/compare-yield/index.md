The `CompareYield` component is responsible for rendering a table that compares the yield opportunities of different NFT animals in the ZOO project. The component imports the `Image` component from the `next/image` library, the `useActiveWeb3React` hook from the `hooks` module, and the `Web3Status` component from the `components` directory. It also imports the `i18n` object and the `t` function from the `@lingui/core` and `@lingui/macro` libraries respectively.

The component defines an array of `nftData` objects that represent different NFT animals in the ZOO project. Each object has an `id`, `name`, `dailyYield`, `medium`, and `large` property. The `dailyYield`, `medium`, and `large` properties are boolean values that indicate whether the animal has a daily yield, medium size, and large size respectively.

The `CompareYield` component returns a JSX element that contains a table with the NFT animal data. The table has a header row that displays the column names, and subsequent rows that display the NFT animal data. The table is generated using the `map` function to iterate over the `nftData` array and generate a row for each object.

The component also renders a header that displays the title and subtitle of the table. Additionally, the component renders three buttons that link to external pages. The first button links to the PancakeSwap page for the ZOO token, the second button links to the ZOO marketplace page, and the third button duplicates the second button.

The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to retrieve the user's account, chain ID, and library. These values are not used in the component, but they may be used in other parts of the project.

Overall, the `CompareYield` component provides a user-friendly way to compare the yield opportunities of different NFT animals in the ZOO project. It also provides links to external pages that are relevant to the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `nftData` array?
- The `nftData` array contains information about different NFT animals, including their names and various attributes such as daily yield, medium, and large.

2. What is the role of the `useActiveWeb3React` hook?
- The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to retrieve information about the user's active Web3 connection, including their account, chain ID, and library.

3. What is the purpose of the `CompareYield` component?
- The `CompareYield` component displays a table comparing the yield opportunities of different NFT animals, as well as buttons for buying $ZOO and accessing the marketplace.
