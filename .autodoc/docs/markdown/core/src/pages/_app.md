The code is the entry point for the Zoo project. It imports various dependencies and sets up the application's global state and providers. The code exports a function called MyApp that takes in an object with two properties: Component and pageProps. The Component property is a Next.js component that is rendered by MyApp, and pageProps are the initial props that are passed to the Component.

The code sets up various providers such as the ThemeProvider, I18nProvider, ReduxProvider, and SubgraphProvider. These providers are used to manage the application's state and provide context to the components. The code also sets up a PersistGate component that wraps the entire application. The PersistGate component is used to persist the application's state across page reloads.

The code initializes Google Analytics and sets up listeners for page views and errors. It also initializes the Lingui translation library and loads the translations for the current locale.

The code defines a GlobalHooks component that is used to conditionally activate the user's wallet connector based on the current chainId. The code also defines a Provider component that is used to conditionally set a provider to be hoisted per page. Similarly, the code defines a Layout component that is used to conditionally set a layout to be hoisted per page. Finally, the code defines a Guard component that is used to conditionally set a guard to be hoisted per page.

The code renders the Component passed to MyApp wrapped in various providers and components. It also renders a NextNProgress component that displays a progress bar at the top of the page when navigating between pages.
