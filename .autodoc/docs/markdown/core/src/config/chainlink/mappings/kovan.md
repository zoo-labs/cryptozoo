The code defines a constant object called `KOVAN_CHAINLINK_MAPPING` that maps various Ethereum contract addresses to their respective Chainlink oracle contract addresses, along with information about the decimals used by each contract. 

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides off-chain data to smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The purpose of this code is to provide a mapping between the contract addresses used by the zoo project and the corresponding Chainlink oracle contract addresses. This mapping is useful because it allows the zoo project to easily retrieve data from the Chainlink oracle contracts without having to hardcode the addresses into the project code.

Each entry in the `KOVAN_CHAINLINK_MAPPING` object contains the following information:

- `from`: the contract address used by the zoo project to retrieve data
- `to`: the corresponding Chainlink oracle contract address
- `decimals`: the number of decimal places used by the contract
- `fromDecimals`: the number of decimal places used by the `from` contract
- `toDecimals`: the number of decimal places used by the `to` contract

For example, the first entry in the object maps the contract address `0xBc3f28Ccc21E9b5856E81E6372aFf57307E2E883` to the Chainlink oracle contract address `0xd0A1E359811322d97991E03f863a0C30C2cF029C`. This entry also specifies that both contracts use 18 decimal places.

Here is an example of how this mapping might be used in the zoo project:

```javascript
import KOVAN_CHAINLINK_MAPPING from 'zoo'

const contractAddress = '0xBc3f28Ccc21E9b5856E81E6372aFf57307E2E883'
const chainlinkAddress = KOVAN_CHAINLINK_MAPPING[contractAddress].to

// Use the Chainlink oracle contract address to retrieve data
// ...
```

Overall, this code provides a convenient way for the zoo project to interact with Chainlink oracle contracts without having to hardcode the contract addresses into the project code.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the `zoo` project?
- This code defines a mapping of addresses to objects containing information about token pairs and their respective decimals. It is likely used in the `zoo` project to facilitate token swaps or other interactions with decentralized exchanges.

2. What is the significance of the `from` and `to` properties in each object?
- The `from` property represents the address of the token being swapped, while the `to` property represents the address of the token being received in the swap.

3. Why are there different values for `fromDecimals` and `toDecimals` in some objects?
- This is likely because the decimals of the two tokens being swapped are different, and these values are used to ensure that the swap is executed correctly.
