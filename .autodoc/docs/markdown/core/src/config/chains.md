The code defines a set of constants and functions that provide information about various Ethereum-compatible blockchains. The `AddEthereumChainParameter` type is imported from the `@web3-react/types` package, and is used to define the structure of the objects that describe each blockchain. 

The `ETH`, `MATIC`, and `BSC` constants define the native currencies of Ethereum, Polygon, and Binance Smart Chain, respectively. These currencies are used in the `ExtendedChainInformation` interface, which extends the `BasicChainInformation` interface to include additional information about each blockchain, such as its native currency and block explorer URLs. 

The `isExtendedChainInformation` function is a type guard that checks whether a given object is an instance of `ExtendedChainInformation`. This is used in the `getAddChainParameters` function to determine whether a given `chainInformation` object is an extended chain information object or not. If it is, the function returns an `AddEthereumChainParameter` object that contains the relevant information about the blockchain. If not, it returns the `chainId` itself. 

The `CHAINS` object is a mapping of chain IDs to chain information objects. Each chain information object contains an array of URLs for connecting to the blockchain, a name, and optionally a native currency and block explorer URLs. The `URLS` object is a mapping of chain IDs to arrays of valid URLs for each chain. 

This code can be used in a larger project to provide users with a list of supported blockchains and their associated information, such as their names, native currencies, and URLs for connecting to them. For example, a web3 application might use this code to display a dropdown menu of supported blockchains, and allow users to switch between them by calling the `getAddChainParameters` function with the appropriate chain ID. 

Example usage:

```
import { CHAINS, getAddChainParameters } from 'zoo';

// Get the chain information for Ethereum mainnet
const ethMainnet = CHAINS[1];

// Check if the chain information is extended or basic
if (isExtendedChainInformation(ethMainnet)) {
  // Get the add chain parameters for Ethereum mainnet
  const addChainParams = getAddChainParameters(1);
  console.log(addChainParams);
  // Output: {
  //   chainId: 1,
  //   chainName: 'Mainnet',
  //   nativeCurrency: {
  //     name: 'Ether',
  //     symbol: 'ETH',
  //     decimals: 18
  //   },
  //   rpcUrls: [
  //     'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-infura-key',
  //     'https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/your-alchemy-key',
  //     'https://cloudflare-eth.com'
  //   ],
  //   blockExplorerUrls: []
  // }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `getAddChainParameters` function?
- The `getAddChainParameters` function takes a `chainId` parameter and returns an `AddEthereumChainParameter` object or a number depending on whether the `chainInformation` object associated with the `chainId` is an `ExtendedChainInformation` object or not.

2. What is the purpose of the `isExtendedChainInformation` function?
- The `isExtendedChainInformation` function is a type guard function that checks whether the `chainInformation` parameter is an `ExtendedChainInformation` object or not, and returns a boolean value.

3. What is the purpose of the `CHAINS` object?
- The `CHAINS` object is a mapping of `chainId` numbers to `BasicChainInformation` or `ExtendedChainInformation` objects, which contain information about the Ethereum chains such as their URLs, names, native currencies, and block explorer URLs.
