This code defines a set of connectors for various wallets that can be used to interact with the Zoo project. The code imports the `AbstractConnector` class from the `@web3-react/abstract-connector` library, which is used as a base class for the wallet connectors. It also imports the `ChainId` enum from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, which is used to specify the chain ID for the RPC URLs.

The code defines several wallet connectors, including `injected`, `metaMask`, `walletConnect`, `coinbaseWallet`, and `Binance`. Each connector is defined as an instance of a connector class, such as `InjectedConnector` or a custom connector class. The `supportedChainIds` variable is defined as an array of chain IDs that are supported by the Zoo project.

The `SUPPORTED_WALLETS` object defines a set of wallet connectors that are supported by the Zoo project. Each wallet connector is defined as an object with properties such as `connector`, `name`, `iconName`, `description`, `href`, `color`, `primary`, `mobile`, and `mobileOnly`. The `connector` property is a reference to the connector instance for the wallet. The `name` property is the name of the wallet. The `iconName` property is the name of the icon file for the wallet. The `description` property is a brief description of the wallet. The `href` property is a URL for the wallet. The `color` property is a hex code for the color of the wallet. The `primary` property is a boolean that indicates whether the wallet is the primary wallet. The `mobile` property is a boolean that indicates whether the wallet is available on mobile devices. The `mobileOnly` property is a boolean that indicates whether the wallet is only available on mobile devices.

This code can be used in the larger Zoo project to provide users with a set of wallet connectors that they can use to interact with the project. For example, the `SUPPORTED_WALLETS` object can be used to display a list of supported wallets on a web page or in a mobile app. The `connector` property of each wallet object can be used to connect to the wallet and interact with the Zoo project. For example, the `metaMask` connector can be used to connect to the MetaMask wallet and interact with the Zoo project using the MetaMask browser extension. Similarly, the `walletConnect` connector can be used to connect to the WalletConnect app and interact with the Zoo project on a mobile device.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines various web3 connectors for different wallets and networks.

2. What is the difference between `metaMask` and `walletConnect` connectors?
- `metaMask` is a connector for the MetaMask browser extension, while `walletConnect` is a connector for various mobile wallets such as Trust Wallet and Rainbow Wallet.

3. Why are some parts of the code commented out?
- It is possible that these parts of the code were previously used but are no longer needed, or they may be under development and not yet ready for use.
