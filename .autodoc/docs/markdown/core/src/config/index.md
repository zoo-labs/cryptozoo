The code above is a simple configuration file for the zoo project. It imports the `ChainId` enum from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library and defines a `config` object with an empty object as its value for the `MAINNET` chain ID. 

The purpose of this file is to provide a central location for storing configuration options for the zoo project. By defining the `config` object, developers can easily access and modify configuration options for the `MAINNET` chain ID throughout the project. 

For example, if the project needed to define a default gas price for transactions on the `MAINNET` chain, the `config` object could be updated to include a `gasPrice` property with the desired value. This value could then be accessed throughout the project by importing the `config` object and referencing the `gasPrice` property.

```
import config from 'zoo/config'

const gasPrice = config[ChainId.MAINNET].gasPrice || 1000000000
```

In the example above, the `config` object is imported and the `gasPrice` property is accessed for the `MAINNET` chain ID. If the `gasPrice` property is not defined in the `config` object, a default value of `1000000000` is used.

Overall, this configuration file provides a simple and flexible way for developers to manage configuration options for the zoo project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChainId` import from `@zoolabs/zdk`?
   - The `ChainId` import is likely used to define different configurations for different blockchain networks.
2. Why is the `config` object empty for the `MAINNET` chain ID?
   - It's possible that the `config` object is intended to be populated with specific configurations for each chain ID, but has not yet been implemented for the `MAINNET` chain ID.
3. What is the intended use of the `config` object and how is it used in the rest of the `zoo` project?
   - Without further context, it's difficult to determine the intended use of the `config` object and how it is used in the rest of the `zoo` project.
