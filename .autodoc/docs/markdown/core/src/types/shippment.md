This code defines a set of interfaces that are used to represent different aspects of a shipment in the larger project. The `Coordinates` interface defines the latitude and longitude of a location. The `ShippingAddress` interface defines the details of a shipping address, including whether it is the default billing or shipping address, the phone number, address line 1, local government area, ID, company, state, coordinates, and full name. The `Currency` interface defines the ISO code and symbol for a currency. Finally, the `Shipment` interface combines all of these interfaces to define a complete shipment, including the shipping address, currency, order number, date issued, customer name, contact phone number, total cost, shipping status, dispatch assignee ID, global order number, sales assignee number, sales assignee name, and group ID.

These interfaces can be used throughout the larger project to represent shipments and their associated data. For example, when creating a new shipment, the `Shipment` interface can be used to define the necessary data, which can then be passed to a function that creates the shipment in the system. Similarly, when retrieving a shipment from the system, the data can be returned as an object that conforms to the `Shipment` interface, making it easy to work with and manipulate the data.

Overall, this code provides a set of standardized interfaces for working with shipments in the larger project, making it easier to create, retrieve, and manipulate shipment data throughout the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Coordinates` interface?
   - The `Coordinates` interface defines the structure of an object that contains latitude and longitude values.
2. What is the significance of the `Shipment` interface?
   - The `Shipment` interface defines the structure of an object that represents a shipment, including details such as the shipping address, currency, order number, and total cost.
3. What is the meaning of the `g` property in the `Shipment` interface?
   - It is unclear what the `g` property represents without additional context or documentation.
