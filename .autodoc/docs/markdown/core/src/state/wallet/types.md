This code defines two types and exports them for use in the larger zoo project. The first type is `TokenAddress`, which is simply a string representing the address of a token. The second type is `TokenBalancesMap`, which is a record (similar to a dictionary or hash map) that maps `TokenAddress` keys to `CurrencyAmount<Token>` values. 

The `CurrencyAmount` and `Token` types are imported from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, which suggests that this code is likely part of the zoo project's integration with that library. `CurrencyAmount` represents a quantity of a particular currency, while `Token` represents a specific token within the zoo project. 

The `TokenBalancesMap` type is likely used to keep track of the balances of various tokens within the zoo project. For example, if a user has 10 ZOO tokens and 5 ETH tokens, their `TokenBalancesMap` might look like this:

```
{
  "ZOO": CurrencyAmount<Token>(10, Token),
  "ETH": CurrencyAmount<Token>(5, Token)
}
```

This code can be used throughout the zoo project to keep track of token balances and perform various operations on them. For example, a function might take a `TokenBalancesMap` as an argument and return the total value of all tokens in a particular currency. 

Overall, this code serves as a foundational piece of the zoo project's token management system, allowing for easy tracking and manipulation of token balances.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `CurrencyAmount` and `Token` imports from `@zoolabs/zdk`?** 
   `CurrencyAmount` and `Token` are likely classes or interfaces defined in the `@zoolabs/zdk` library that are used in this code to represent currency amounts and tokens respectively.

2. **What is the `TokenAddress` type used for?** 
   `TokenAddress` is a type alias for the `string` type, and is likely used to represent the address of a token in the `TokenBalancesMap`.

3. **What is the `TokenBalancesMap` type used for?** 
   `TokenBalancesMap` is a type alias for a `Record` object that maps `TokenAddress` keys to `CurrencyAmount<Token>` values. This type is likely used to represent a mapping of token addresses to their respective balances.
