The code in this file provides various hooks for retrieving token and ETH balances for a given address. It imports several dependencies from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, as well as several hooks and utility functions from other files in the project. 

The `useETHBalances` hook takes an array of addresses and returns a map of those addresses to their ETH balances. It uses the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the current chain ID, and the `useMulticall2Contract` hook to get a contract instance for the `Multicall2` contract. It then uses the `useSingleContractMultipleData` hook to get the ETH balance for each address in the array, and returns a map of those balances.

The `useTokenBalancesWithLoadingIndicator` hook takes an address and an array of tokens, and returns a map of those tokens to their balances for the given address. It uses the `useMultipleContractSingleData` hook to get the balance of each token for the given address, and returns a tuple containing the balances map and a boolean indicating whether any of the calls are still loading.

The `useTokenBalances` hook is a wrapper around `useTokenBalancesWithLoadingIndicator` that returns only the balances map.

The `useTokenBalance` hook takes an address and a token, and returns the balance of that token for the given address. It uses `useTokenBalances` to get the balances map, and returns the balance for the given token.

The `useCurrencyBalances` hook takes an address and an array of currencies, and returns an array of balances for those currencies. It uses `useTokenBalances` and `useETHBalances` to get the balances for tokens and ETH, respectively, and returns an array of balances in the same order as the input array.

The `useCurrencyBalance` hook is a wrapper around `useCurrencyBalances` that returns only the balance for a single currency.

The `useAllTokenBalances` hook returns a map of all tokens to their balances for the current account. It uses `useAllTokens` to get a list of all tokens, and `useTokenBalances` to get the balances map.

Overall, these hooks provide a convenient way to retrieve token and ETH balances for a given address, and can be used throughout the project to display balances in various contexts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useTokenBalancesWithLoadingIndicator` function?
- The `useTokenBalancesWithLoadingIndicator` function returns a map of token addresses to their eventually consistent token balances for a single account, along with a boolean indicating whether any of the calls are still loading.

2. What is the difference between `useTokenBalances` and `useTokenBalance`?
- `useTokenBalances` returns a map of token addresses to their eventually consistent token balances for a single account, while `useTokenBalance` returns the balance for a single token/account combination.

3. What is the purpose of the `useCurrencyBalances` function?
- The `useCurrencyBalances` function returns an array of currency amounts (either token or ETH) for a single account and an array of currencies, with undefined values for any currencies that are not tokens or ETH.
