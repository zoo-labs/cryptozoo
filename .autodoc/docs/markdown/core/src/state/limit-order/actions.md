This file contains a set of Redux actions that are used in the larger project called "zoo". Redux is a state management library that is commonly used in React applications. The purpose of this file is to define a set of actions that can be dispatched to update the state of the application.

The first thing that is imported is the `createAction` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` package. This function is used to create a new Redux action. An action is a plain JavaScript object that describes a change that should be made to the state of the application. Actions are dispatched to the Redux store, which then updates the state of the application accordingly.

The file then defines a set of actions using the `createAction` function. Each action has a unique name and a payload that can be used to update the state of the application. For example, the `setLimitPrice` action takes a string or null value as its payload and updates the limit price of a limit order. The `replaceLimitOrderState` action takes a complex object as its payload and updates multiple fields of a limit order.

In addition to the actions, the file also defines an enum called `Field`. This enum is used to specify which field of a limit order is being updated. The `Field` enum has two possible values: `INPUT` and `OUTPUT`.

These actions can be used in the larger project to update the state of the application in response to user interactions. For example, when a user types in a new limit price for a limit order, the `setLimitPrice` action can be dispatched with the new value as its payload. This will update the state of the application and cause the UI to re-render with the new limit price displayed.

Here is an example of how the `setLimitPrice` action can be used in a React component:

```
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { setLimitPrice } from './path/to/limit-order-actions';

function LimitOrderForm() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  function handleLimitPriceChange(event) {
    const newLimitPrice = event.target.value;
    dispatch(setLimitPrice(newLimitPrice));
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <label>
        Limit Price:
        <input type="text" onChange={handleLimitPriceChange} />
      </label>
    </form>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `setLimitPrice` action is imported from the `limit-order-actions` module and used to update the limit price of a limit order when the user types in a new value in the input field. The `useDispatch` hook is used to get a reference to the Redux store's `dispatch` function, which is then used to dispatch the `setLimitPrice` action with the new value as its payload.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `createAction` function being imported from `@reduxjs/toolkit`?
   - The `createAction` function is used to create Redux actions with a specified type and payload.
2. What is the `Field` enum used for?
   - The `Field` enum defines two constants, `INPUT` and `OUTPUT`, which are used to specify the input and output fields in the `replaceLimitOrderState` action.
3. What is the purpose of the `replaceLimitOrderState` action and what payload does it accept?
   - The `replaceLimitOrderState` action is used to replace the entire state of the limit order feature with a new state. It accepts an object payload with various properties such as `independentField`, `typedValue`, `inputCurrencyId`, `outputCurrencyId`, `recipient`, `fromBentoBalance`, `limitPrice`, and `orderExpiration`.
