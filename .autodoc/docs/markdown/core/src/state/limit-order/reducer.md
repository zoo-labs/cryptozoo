This code defines a Redux reducer for managing the state of a limit order form in a decentralized exchange application. The `LimitOrderState` interface defines the shape of the state object, which includes fields for the input and output currencies, the typed value, the limit price, the recipient address, and other related data. The `OrderExpiration` enum defines the possible values for the order expiration time.

The `initialState` object defines the initial state of the form, with empty values for all fields. The `createReducer` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library is used to create a reducer function that handles various actions dispatched by the application.

The `replaceLimitOrderState` action is dispatched when the user updates the form with new data. The reducer updates the state with the new values for the input and output currencies, the typed value, the limit price, the recipient address, and other related data. The `setLimitPrice`, `setLimitOrderApprovalPending`, `setOrderExpiration`, `setFromBentoBalance`, `selectCurrency`, `switchCurrencies`, `typeInput`, and `setRecipient` actions are used to update specific fields of the state object in response to user input.

Overall, this code provides a way to manage the state of a limit order form in a decentralized exchange application, allowing users to specify the input and output currencies, the limit price, the recipient address, and other related data. The reducer function can be used in conjunction with other Redux middleware and components to create a fully functional limit order form. 

Example usage:

```javascript
import { createStore } from 'redux';
import limitOrderReducer from './limitOrderReducer';

const store = createStore(limitOrderReducer);

// Dispatch an action to update the input currency
store.dispatch(selectCurrency({ currencyId: 'ETH', field: Field.INPUT }));

// Dispatch an action to update the limit price
store.dispatch(setLimitPrice('0.1'));

// Get the current state of the limit order form
const state = store.getState();
console.log(state);
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `LimitOrderState` interface?
- The `LimitOrderState` interface defines the shape of the state object for the limit order feature, including fields such as `independentField`, `typedValue`, `limitPrice`, `recipient`, and `orderExpiration`.

2. What is the significance of the `OrderExpiration` enum?
- The `OrderExpiration` enum provides a set of possible values for the `orderExpiration` field in the `LimitOrderState` object, including `never`, `hour`, `day`, `week`, and `month`.

3. What actions can trigger changes to the `LimitOrderState` object?
- The `LimitOrderState` object can be updated by dispatching actions such as `replaceLimitOrderState`, `setLimitPrice`, `setLimitOrderApprovalPending`, `setOrderExpiration`, `setFromBentoBalance`, `selectCurrency`, `switchCurrencies`, `typeInput`, and `setRecipient`. These actions are defined in the `./actions` module and are handled by the `createReducer` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library.
