The code is a module that exports several functions and a hook that are used in the larger project called "zoo". The module contains functions that handle limit order actions, derive limit order information, and parse URL parameters to swap state. It also exports a hook that returns the current limit order state.

The `useLimitOrderActionHandlers` function returns an object with four functions that handle different actions related to limit orders. The `onCurrencySelection` function selects a currency for a given field (either input or output) and dispatches a `selectCurrency` action. The `onSwitchTokens` function switches the input and output currencies and dispatches a `switchCurrencies` action. The `onUserInput` function updates the typed value for a given field and dispatches a `typeInput` action. The `onChangeRecipient` function updates the recipient address and dispatches a `setRecipient` action.

The `useDerivedLimitOrderInfo` hook returns an object with several properties that are derived from the current limit order state. The `currencies` property is an object that contains the input and output currencies. The `parsedAmounts` property is an object that contains the parsed input and output amounts. The `walletBalances` property is an object that contains the wallet balances for the input and output currencies. The `bentoboxBalances` property is an object that contains the BentoBox balances for the input and output currencies. The `inputError` property is a string that contains an error message if there is an error with the input. The `currentPrice` property is the current price for the input and output currencies.

The `useLimitOrderState` function returns the current limit order state from the Redux store.

The `queryParametersToSwapState` function parses URL parameters and returns an object that contains the input and output currencies, the typed value, the independent field, the recipient address, the limit price, whether to use the BentoBox balance, and the order expiration.

The `useDefaultsFromURLSearch` hook sets the default limit order state based on the URL parameters and dispatches a `replaceLimitOrderState` action.

Overall, this module provides functions and a hook that are used to handle limit order actions, derive limit order information, and parse URL parameters to swap state in the larger "zoo" project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useLimitOrderActionHandlers` function?
- The `useLimitOrderActionHandlers` function returns an object containing functions that handle user actions such as currency selection, token switching, user input, and recipient change for a limit order.

2. What is the `useDerivedLimitOrderInfo` function used for?
- The `useDerivedLimitOrderInfo` function returns an object containing derived information for a limit order such as selected currencies, parsed amounts, wallet and bentobox balances, input error, and current price.

3. What is the purpose of the `queryParametersToSwapState` function?
- The `queryParametersToSwapState` function converts query parameters from a URL into a swap state object containing input and output currencies, typed value, independent field, recipient, limit price, and order expiration.
