This code is a module that exports several functions and types related to the application state of a larger project called "zoo". The module imports two functions from external libraries: `createAction` from "@reduxjs/toolkit" and `TokenList` from "@uniswap/token-lists". 

The module defines a type `PopupContent` which is a union of two possible objects: `txn` and `listUpdate`. The `txn` object has three properties: `hash` (a string), `success` (a boolean), and `summary` (an optional string). The `listUpdate` object has four properties: `listUrl` (a string), `oldList` (a `TokenList` object), `newList` (another `TokenList` object), and `auto` (a boolean). 

The module also defines an enum `ApplicationModal` which lists several possible modal types that can be opened in the application. Each modal type is represented by a string value. 

The module exports several functions that create Redux actions using `createAction`. The `updateBlockNumber` function takes an object with two properties (`chainId` and `blockNumber`) and returns an action that updates the block number for a given chain. The `setOpenModal` function takes an `ApplicationModal` value or `null` and returns an action that sets the currently open modal in the application. The `addPopup` function takes an object with three properties (`key`, `removeAfterMs`, and `content`) and returns an action that adds a popup to the application. The `removePopup` function takes an object with one property (`key`) and returns an action that removes a popup from the application. The `setKashiApprovalPending` function takes a string and returns an action that sets the Kashi approval status in the application. The `setPriorityConnector` function takes any value and returns an action that sets the priority connector in the application.

Overall, this module provides a set of functions and types that can be used to manage the application state of the larger "zoo" project. For example, the `setOpenModal` function could be used to open a specific modal in response to a user action, while the `addPopup` function could be used to display a notification to the user. The `updateBlockNumber` function could be used to keep track of the latest block number for a given chain, while the `setPriorityConnector` function could be used to set the preferred connector for interacting with a blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `PopupContent` type and what are the possible values it can hold?
- The `PopupContent` type is used to define the content of a popup. It can hold either a `txn` object with `hash`, `success`, and optional `summary` properties, or a `listUpdate` object with `listUrl`, `oldList`, `newList`, and `auto` properties.

2. What is the `ApplicationModal` enum used for?
- The `ApplicationModal` enum is used to define the different types of modals that can be opened in the application. It includes values such as `WALLET`, `SETTINGS`, `VOTE`, and `HATCH_EGG`, among others.

3. What actions can be dispatched using the `createAction` function?
- The `createAction` function can be used to create several different actions, including `updateBlockNumber`, `setOpenModal`, `addPopup`, `removePopup`, `setKashiApprovalPending`, and `setPriorityConnector`. Each action has a different payload and purpose within the application.
