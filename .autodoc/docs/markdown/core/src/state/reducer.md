This code is a part of a larger project called "zoo" and it imports the `combineReducers` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library. The purpose of this code is to combine all the reducers from different modules of the project into a single reducer that can be used by the Redux store.

The `combineReducers` function takes an object as an argument, where each key represents a slice of the state and the corresponding value is the reducer function that manages that slice of the state. In this code, the object passed to `combineReducers` contains all the reducers from different modules of the project. Each reducer is imported from a separate file and given a key that represents the slice of the state it manages.

For example, the `application` reducer manages the state related to the application, such as the current theme, language, and notifications. Similarly, the `user` reducer manages the state related to the user, such as the user's wallet address, balance, and transaction history. The `transactions` reducer manages the state related to the transactions, such as the pending and completed transactions. The `swap`, `mint`, `burn`, and `limitOrder` reducers manage the state related to the corresponding functionalities of the project.

Once all the reducers are combined using `combineReducers`, the resulting reducer is exported as the default export of this module. This combined reducer can then be used to create the Redux store for the project.

For example, in another module of the project, we can import this combined reducer and use it to create the Redux store as follows:

```
import { createStore } from "redux";
import rootReducer from "./path/to/rootReducer";

const store = createStore(rootReducer);
```

In summary, this code combines all the reducers from different modules of the "zoo" project into a single reducer that can be used to create the Redux store. This allows the project to manage its state in a structured and organized way, making it easier to maintain and scale.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is combining multiple reducers from different files into a single reducer using the `combineReducers` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library.

2. What are the different reducers being combined?
   - The different reducers being combined are `application`, `user`, `transactions`, `swap`, `mint`, `burn`, `multicall`, `network`, `lists`, `limitOrder`, `create`, `inari`, `zoo`, `store`, `voting`, `bridge`, and `drop`.

3. What is the significance of the `zoo` reducer?
   - The `zoo` reducer is one of the reducers being combined and it is likely specific to this project. Without more context, it is unclear what its purpose is within the overall application.
