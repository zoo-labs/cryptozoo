This code defines a Redux slice for managing a stack of toast notifications. Toast notifications are small messages that appear on the screen to provide feedback to the user. The `ToastsState` type is defined in a separate file and specifies that the `data` property is an array of `Toast` objects. 

The `createSlice` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library is used to create the slice. It takes an object with several properties, including `name`, `initialState`, and `reducers`. The `name` property is a string that identifies the slice in the Redux store. The `initialState` property is an object that specifies the initial state of the slice. In this case, the `data` property is an empty array. The `reducers` property is an object that defines the actions that can be dispatched to modify the state of the slice.

The `push` reducer adds a new toast to the top of the stack. It takes a `Toast` object as its payload and adds it to the beginning of the `data` array. If a toast with the same `id` already exists in the stack, it is removed before the new toast is added. This ensures that there are no duplicate toasts in the stack.

The `remove` reducer removes a toast from the stack. It takes a string as its payload, which is the `id` of the toast to be removed. It finds the index of the toast with the matching `id` and removes it from the `data` array.

The `clear` reducer removes all toasts from the stack. It sets the `data` property to an empty array.

The `push`, `remove`, and `clear` actions are exported from the module and can be used to dispatch the corresponding reducers. The `default` export is the reducer function itself.

This code can be used in a larger project to manage toast notifications. Other parts of the application can dispatch the `push` action to add new toasts to the stack, the `remove` action to remove a specific toast, or the `clear` action to remove all toasts. The state of the toast stack can be accessed from the Redux store using the `toasts` slice name. For example, to get the current stack of toasts:

```javascript
import { useSelector } from 'react-redux'

const toasts = useSelector((state) => state.toasts.data)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ToastsState` type?
   - The `ToastsState` type is used to define the initial state of the `toastsSlice` slice, which contains an array of `Toast` objects.
2. What is the role of the `push` reducer function?
   - The `push` reducer function is used to add a new `Toast` object to the beginning of the `data` array in the `toastsSlice` slice. If a `Toast` with the same `id` already exists in the array, it is removed before the new `Toast` is added.
3. What is the relationship between the `toastsSlice` slice and the `clear`, `remove`, and `push` actions?
   - The `toastsSlice` slice is created using the `createSlice` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library, and it defines the `clear`, `remove`, and `push` actions as reducers. These actions can be dispatched to modify the state of the `toastsSlice` slice.
