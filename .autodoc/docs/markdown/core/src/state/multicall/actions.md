This code defines a set of actions and an interface for a Redux store related to fetching data from multiple sources in a blockchain network. The `ListenerOptions` interface defines an object with a single property, `blocksPerFetch`, which specifies how often data should be fetched. The `addMulticallListeners` and `removeMulticallListeners` actions take in an object with three properties: `chainId`, which specifies the blockchain network to fetch data from, `calls`, which is an array of `Call` objects that specify the data to fetch, and `options`, which is an object of type `ListenerOptions`. These actions are used to add and remove listeners for fetching data from multiple sources in the blockchain network.

The `fetchingMulticallResults` action takes in an object with three properties: `chainId`, `calls`, and `fetchingBlockNumber`. This action is dispatched when the data is being fetched from the blockchain network. The `errorFetchingMulticallResults` action takes in an object with the same properties as `fetchingMulticallResults`, but is dispatched when there is an error fetching the data.

The `updateMulticallResults` action takes in an object with three properties: `chainId`, `blockNumber`, and `results`. This action is dispatched when the data has been successfully fetched from the blockchain network. The `results` property is an object with keys that correspond to the `Call` objects in the `calls` array, and values that are either strings or null.

Overall, this code provides a set of actions and an interface for fetching data from multiple sources in a blockchain network. These actions can be used in a Redux store to manage the state of the data fetching process. For example, the `addMulticallListeners` action can be dispatched when a component mounts to start fetching data, and the `updateMulticallResults` action can be used to update the state of the store with the fetched data. Here is an example of how these actions can be used in a Redux store:

```
import { createStore } from 'redux'
import { addMulticallListeners, updateMulticallResults } from './path/to/zoo'

const initialState = {
  data: {}
}

function reducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'multicall/addMulticallListeners':
      // start fetching data
      return state
    case 'multicall/updateMulticallResults':
      // update state with fetched data
      return {
        ...state,
        data: {
          ...state.data,
          [action.chainId]: {
            ...state.data[action.chainId],
            [action.blockNumber]: action.results
          }
        }
      }
    default:
      return state
  }
}

const store = createStore(reducer)

// dispatch addMulticallListeners action to start fetching data
store.dispatch(addMulticallListeners({
  chainId: 1,
  calls: [{}, {}, {}],
  options: { blocksPerFetch: 1 }
}))

// dispatch updateMulticallResults action to update state with fetched data
store.dispatch(updateMulticallResults({
  chainId: 1,
  blockNumber: 12345,
  results: {
    'call1': 'result1',
    'call2': 'result2',
    'call3': null
  }
}))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Call` interface in the `import` statement?
- The `Call` interface is imported from the `utils` module, but its purpose is not clear from this code alone.

2. What is the `multicall` feature and how does it work?
- The code defines several actions related to `multicall`, but it is not clear what this feature is or how it is implemented.

3. What is the expected format of the `results` object in the `updateMulticallResults` action?
- The `updateMulticallResults` action takes an object with a `results` property that is an object with string keys and string or null values. It is not clear what these keys and values represent or how they are used.
