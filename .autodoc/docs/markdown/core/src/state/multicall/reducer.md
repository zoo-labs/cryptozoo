This code defines a Redux reducer for handling the state of a multicall feature in the larger project. The multicall feature allows for batching of multiple Ethereum contract function calls into a single request, which can improve performance and reduce gas costs. 

The `MulticallState` interface defines the shape of the state object, which includes two properties: `callListeners` and `callResults`. `callListeners` is an object that stores the preferences of listeners for each call key and how many listeners there are per each blocks per fetch preference. `callResults` is an object that stores the results of each call key, including the data returned, the block number at which the call was made, and the block number at which the data was fetched. 

The `initialState` object sets the initial state of the reducer, which only includes an empty `callResults` object. 

The `createReducer` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library is used to create the reducer. The `builder` object is used to define the reducer's behavior for each action type. 

The `addMulticallListeners` action adds listeners for multiple contract function calls. It takes in an array of `calls`, a `chainId`, and an object of `options` that includes a `blocksPerFetch` preference. The reducer updates the `callListeners` object to include the new listeners for the specified `chainId` and `callKey`. If the `callKey` or `blocksPerFetch` preference already exists, the listener count is incremented. 

The `removeMulticallListeners` action removes listeners for multiple contract function calls. It takes in an array of `calls`, a `chainId`, and an object of `options` that includes a `blocksPerFetch` preference. The reducer updates the `callListeners` object to remove the specified listeners for the specified `chainId` and `callKey`. If the `callKey` or `blocksPerFetch` preference still has listeners, the listener count is decremented. 

The `fetchingMulticallResults` action updates the `callResults` object to indicate that the specified contract function calls are being fetched. It takes in a `chainId`, a `fetchingBlockNumber`, and an array of `calls`. The reducer updates the `callResults` object to include the specified `fetchingBlockNumber` for each `callKey`. If the `callKey` already has a `fetchingBlockNumber` that is greater than or equal to the specified `fetchingBlockNumber`, the reducer does not update the state. 

The `errorFetchingMulticallResults` action updates the `callResults` object to indicate that there was an error fetching the specified contract function calls. It takes in a `fetchingBlockNumber`, a `chainId`, and an array of `calls`. The reducer updates the `callResults` object to set the `data` property to `null` for each `callKey` that has a `fetchingBlockNumber` equal to the specified `fetchingBlockNumber`. 

The `updateMulticallResults` action updates the `callResults` object with the results of the specified contract function calls. It takes in a `chainId`, an object of `results` that maps `callKey` to data, and a `blockNumber`. The reducer updates the `callResults` object to include the specified `results` and `blockNumber` for each `callKey`. If the `callKey` already has a `blockNumber` that is greater than the specified `blockNumber`, the reducer does not update the state. 

Overall, this code provides a way to manage the state of a multicall feature in the larger project. It allows for adding and removing listeners for multiple contract function calls, tracking the results of those calls, and handling errors that may occur during the fetching process. This code can be used in conjunction with other parts of the project to implement the multicall feature and improve performance and gas costs. 

Example usage:

```javascript
import multicallReducer from './multicallReducer'
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    multicall: multicallReducer,
  },
})

// Add listeners for multiple contract function calls
store.dispatch(addMulticallListeners({
  calls: [
    { address: '0x123...', data: '0x123...' },
    { address: '0x456...', data: '0x456...' },
  ],
  chainId: 1,
  options: { blocksPerFetch: 5 },
}))

// Fetch the results of the contract function calls
store.dispatch(fetchingMulticallResults({
  chainId: 1,
  fetchingBlockNumber: 12345,
  calls: [
    { address: '0x123...', data: '0x123...' },
    { address: '0x456...', data: '0x456...' },
  ],
}))

// Update the results of the contract function calls
store.dispatch(updateMulticallResults({
  chainId: 1,
  results: {
    '0x123...': '0xabc...',
    '0x456...': '0xdef...',
  },
  blockNumber: 12345,
}))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Redux reducer for handling multicall state, which includes call listeners and call results for different chains.

2. What are the inputs and outputs of the `addMulticallListeners` function?
- The `addMulticallListeners` function takes in an array of calls, a chain ID, and a blocks per fetch option, and updates the call listeners state accordingly. It does not have any output.

3. What is the purpose of the `updateMulticallResults` case?
- The `updateMulticallResults` case updates the call results state with the results of a multicall query for a specific chain and block number. It only updates the state for call keys that have not already been updated with a later block number.
