This code defines a Redux reducer for managing transaction details in a multi-chain environment. The `TransactionDetails` interface defines the shape of a transaction object, which includes various details such as the transaction hash, approval information, summary, claim recipient, receipt, and timestamps. The `TransactionState` interface defines the shape of the state object, which is a nested object with chain IDs as keys and transaction hashes as sub-keys, with each value being a `TransactionDetails` object.

The reducer defines four cases using the `createReducer` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` package. The `addTransaction` case adds a new transaction to the state object, given the chain ID, sender address, transaction hash, approval information, summary, claim recipient, and Archer details. If the transaction already exists in the state object, an error is thrown. The `clearAllTransactions` case clears all transactions for a given chain ID. The `checkedTransaction` case updates the last checked block number for a given transaction hash and chain ID. The `finalizeTransaction` case updates the transaction receipt and confirmed time for a given transaction hash and chain ID.

This reducer can be used in a larger project that involves managing transactions across multiple chains, such as a decentralized exchange or a wallet application. For example, when a user initiates a transaction, the `addTransaction` case can be called to add the transaction details to the state object. As the transaction is processed and confirmed, the `checkedTransaction` and `finalizeTransaction` cases can be called to update the transaction details. The `clearAllTransactions` case can be used to clear all transactions for a given chain ID when the user switches to a different network. 

Example usage:

```
import { addTransaction } from './actions'
import transactionReducer from './transactionReducer'

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    transactions: transactionReducer,
  },
})

const chainId = 1
const from = '0x123abc'
const hash = '0x456def'
const approval = { tokenAddress: '0x789ghi', spender: '0xabcjkl' }
const summary = 'Transaction summary'
const claim = { recipient: '0xdefmno' }
const archer = { deadline: 123456789, rawTransaction: '0x123abc', nonce: 1, ethTip: '0.1' }

store.dispatch(addTransaction({ chainId, from, hash, approval, summary, claim, archer }))
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a Redux reducer for managing transaction details, including adding, checking, and finalizing transactions.

2. What is the `TransactionDetails` interface used for?
- The `TransactionDetails` interface defines the shape of an object that stores details about a transaction, including its hash, approval, summary, claim, receipt, and other metadata.

3. What is the `archer` property in the `TransactionDetails` interface?
- The `archer` property is an optional object that stores additional details about a transaction that was submitted via Archer, including the deadline, raw transaction data, nonce, and ETH tip.
