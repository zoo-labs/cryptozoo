The `Updater` function in the `zoo` project is responsible for updating the state of transactions in the application. It does this by checking the status of transactions that have been submitted to the blockchain and updating the application state accordingly. 

The `Updater` function imports several functions and hooks from other files in the project. These include `AppDispatch` and `AppState` from the `index` file, `RetryOptions`, `RetryableError`, and `retry` from the `retry` file, `checkedTransaction` and `finalizeTransaction` from the `actions` file, and `useAddPopup` and `useBlockNumber` from the `hooks` file. 

The `Updater` function also imports `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and `useMemo` from the `react` library, and `ChainId` and `updateBlockNumber` from the `zdk` library. 

The `Updater` function defines an interface called `TxInterface` that describes the properties of a transaction object. The `shouldCheck` function takes a `lastBlockNumber` and a `tx` object as arguments and returns a boolean value indicating whether the transaction should be checked. 

The `Updater` function defines two constants: `RETRY_OPTIONS_BY_CHAIN_ID` and `DEFAULT_RETRY_OPTIONS`. These constants are used to set the retry options for fetching transaction receipts. 

The `Updater` function then defines a component that returns `null`. This component uses several hooks to get the current state of the application, including `useActiveWeb3React`, `useBlockNumber`, `useAppDispatch`, and `useAppSelector`. 

The `Updater` function also defines a `getReceipt` function that takes a transaction hash as an argument and returns a promise that resolves to the transaction receipt. This function uses the `retry` function to retry fetching the receipt if it is not available. 

The `Updater` function uses the `useEffect` hook to check the status of transactions and update the application state accordingly. This hook runs whenever the `chainId`, `library`, `transactions`, `lastBlockNumber`, `dispatch`, `addPopup`, or `getReceipt` values change. 

Overall, the `Updater` function is an important part of the `zoo` project that ensures that the application state is updated with the latest information about transactions submitted to the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `shouldCheck` function?
- The `shouldCheck` function determines whether a transaction should be checked for updates based on its current state and how long it has been pending.

2. What is the significance of the `RETRY_OPTIONS_BY_CHAIN_ID` and `DEFAULT_RETRY_OPTIONS` constants?
- These constants define the retry options for fetching transaction receipts based on the current chain ID. If the chain ID is not recognized, the default options are used.

3. What is the purpose of the `Updater` component?
- The `Updater` component is responsible for periodically checking the status of pending transactions and updating the state of the application accordingly. It also handles fetching transaction receipts and displaying popups on confirmation.
