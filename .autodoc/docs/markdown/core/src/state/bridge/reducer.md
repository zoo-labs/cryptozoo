This code defines a Redux reducer for a project called "Swap". The reducer manages the state of the Swap application, which allows users to swap tokens on different blockchain networks. 

The `SwapState` interface defines the shape of the state object, which includes properties such as `loading`, `tokens`, `currentTrade`, `error`, `currentSelectSide`, `currentAmount`, `balances`, and `activeChains`. These properties represent various aspects of the application's state, such as whether data is currently being loaded, which tokens are available for swapping, the current trade being executed, any errors that occur, and the current balances and amounts being swapped.

The `initialState` object defines the initial state of the application, which includes default values for each of the state properties. For example, the `currentAmount` property is initialized with a default value of `{ to: 0, from: 0.1 }`, which represents the amount of tokens being swapped from and to the selected tokens.

The `createReducer` function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library is used to create the reducer function. The `builder` argument is used to define the reducer's behavior for each action type. For example, the `addCase` method is used to define how the reducer should update the state in response to the `loading` action, which sets the `loading` property to the value of the `action.payload`.

Overall, this code defines the state management for the Swap application, which allows users to swap tokens on different blockchain networks. The reducer manages the state of the application, including loading data, updating token and balance information, and executing trades. The reducer can be used in conjunction with other parts of the application, such as UI components and middleware, to create a fully functional Swap application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines the initial state and a reducer function for a Redux store related to a swapping feature for tokens on different chains.

2. What are the types of data that this code is handling?
- This code is handling various types of data such as tokens, balances, errors, and chain IDs, which are defined in the imported `types` module.

3. What actions can trigger updates to the state in this code?
- There are several actions defined in the imported `action` module that can trigger updates to the state, such as `loading`, `fetchTokens`, `updateCurrentTrade`, `updateError`, `updateCurrentSelectSide`, `updateCurrentAmount`, `fetchBalances`, `updateCurrentBalances`, and `updateActiveChains`. These actions are handled by the reducer function defined in this code.
