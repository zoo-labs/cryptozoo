This code is a module that exports three Redux actions: `setStrategy`, `setZapIn`, and `setValues`. These actions are used to update the state of the `inari` slice of the Redux store in the larger project. 

The `setStrategy` action takes a `Strategy` object as its payload and updates the `strategy` property of the `inari` slice in the Redux store. The `Strategy` type is likely defined in the `types` module that is imported at the top of this file. An example usage of this action could be:

```
import { setStrategy } from 'zoo'

const myStrategy = { name: 'aggressive', riskLevel: 'high' }
dispatch(setStrategy(myStrategy))
```

The `setZapIn` action takes a boolean value as its payload and updates the `zapIn` property of the `inari` slice in the Redux store. This property likely controls whether or not a certain feature is enabled in the larger project. An example usage of this action could be:

```
import { setZapIn } from 'zoo'

dispatch(setZapIn(true))
```

The `setValues` action takes an object with two string properties (`inputValue` and `outputValue`) as its payload and updates the `inputValue` and `outputValue` properties of the `inari` slice in the Redux store. This action is likely used to update the values of certain inputs and outputs in the larger project. An example usage of this action could be:

```
import { setValues } from 'zoo'

const newValues = { inputValue: 'hello', outputValue: 'world' }
dispatch(setValues(newValues))
```

Overall, this module provides a simple interface for updating the state of the `inari` slice in the Redux store, which is likely used to control various features and inputs/outputs in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `createAction` function from `@reduxjs/toolkit`?
- `createAction` is a function from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library that creates an action creator function for Redux. It takes a type parameter that defines the type of the action payload.

2. What is the `Strategy` type from the `types` module used for?
- The `Strategy` type is used as the payload type for the `setStrategy` action creator. It likely represents some kind of strategy object or configuration.

3. What is the purpose of the `setZapIn` and `setValues` action creators?
- `setZapIn` and `setValues` are action creators that likely update some state related to input values or settings in the `inari` slice of the Redux store. The former takes a boolean payload, while the latter takes an object with two string properties.
