The code is a collection of React hooks that are used to manage the state of the Inari DEX (decentralized exchange) in the larger Zoo project. The Inari DEX is a platform that allows users to swap tokens on different blockchains. 

The `useInariState` hook is used to retrieve the current state of the Inari DEX from the Redux store. The `useDerivedInariState` hook is used to derive a new state object from the `useInariState` hook. This is necessary because the `Token` class used in the `tokens` property of the state object is not serializable and cannot be stored in the Redux store. The `useSelectedInariStrategy` hook is used to retrieve the currently selected strategy from the Inari state object. Finally, the `useInariStrategies` hook is used to register all the available strategies for the Inari DEX.

The `useDerivedInariState` hook uses the `useMemo` hook to create two new `Token` objects from the `inputToken` and `outputToken` properties of the `tokens` object in the Inari state. These `Token` objects are then used to parse the `inputValue` and `outputValue` properties of the Inari state object using the `tryParseAmount` function from the `functions` module. The resulting derived state object is returned by the hook.

The `useInariStrategies` hook is used to register all the available strategies for the Inari DEX. It uses the `useStakeSushiToBentoStrategy`, `useStakeSushiToCreamStrategy`, and `useStakeSushiToAaveStrategy` hooks to create instances of the different strategies. These instances are then stored in an object and returned by the hook.

Overall, these hooks are used to manage the state of the Inari DEX in the Zoo project. They allow developers to easily retrieve and derive state information, as well as register and retrieve available strategies. Here is an example of how the `useInariState` hook can be used in a component:

```
import { useInariState } from './path/to/inari/hooks';

function MyComponent() {
  const inariState = useInariState();

  // Use inariState to render component
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useDerivedInariState` hook?
- The `useDerivedInariState` hook is used to derive complex state values from the `useInariState` hook, which is a Redux selector. It creates new instances of `Token` objects based on the input and output tokens, and parses the input and output values using the `tryParseAmount` function.

2. Why are the strategy hooks not used in the `useDerivedInariState` hook?
- The strategy hooks are not used in the `useDerivedInariState` hook to avoid an infinite loop. Since the `useDerivedInariState` hook is called every time the state changes, using the strategy hooks could cause an infinite loop of state updates.

3. What is the purpose of the `useInariStrategies` hook?
- The `useInariStrategies` hook is used to register all available strategies for the Inari state. It creates an object with each strategy as a property, using the strategy ID as the key.
