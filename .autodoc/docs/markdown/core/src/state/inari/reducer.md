This code defines a Redux reducer for the InariState slice of the store in the larger project. The InariState represents the state of the Inari DEX, which allows users to swap tokens between different protocols. The reducer handles three actions: setStrategy, setZapIn, and setValues.

The setStrategy action updates the state with a new strategy object, which contains information about the tokens being swapped and the exchange rate. The reducer updates the state by merging the new strategy object with the existing state, and then updating the general and tokens properties to reflect the new strategy. If the zapIn property is true, the input token and symbol are set to the strategy's input token and symbol, and the output token and symbol are set to the strategy's output token and symbol. Otherwise, the input and output tokens and symbols are swapped. Finally, the inputValue and outputValue properties are reset to empty strings.

The setZapIn action toggles the zapIn property of the state, which determines whether the user is swapping tokens in or out of the Inari DEX. The reducer updates the state by swapping the input and output symbols and tokens in the general and tokens properties, and swapping the inputValue and outputValue properties.

The setValues action updates the inputValue and outputValue properties of the state with the user's input and output amounts.

Overall, this reducer is a critical part of the Inari DEX functionality, as it handles the state changes required for swapping tokens between different protocols. It can be used in conjunction with other reducers and actions to build a complete trading interface for the Inari DEX. Here is an example of how this reducer might be used in a React component:

```
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { setStrategy, setZapIn, setValues } from './actions';
import { InariState } from './types';

function InariSwap() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const inariState = useSelector((state: { inari: InariState }) => state.inari);

  const handleStrategyChange = (strategy: any) => {
    dispatch(setStrategy(strategy));
  };

  const handleZapInToggle = () => {
    dispatch(setZapIn(!inariState.zapIn));
  };

  const handleValuesChange = (inputValue: string, outputValue: string) => {
    dispatch(setValues({ inputValue, outputValue }));
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleZapInToggle}>Toggle Zap In/Out</button>
      <input value={inariState.inputValue} onChange={(e) => handleValuesChange(e.target.value, inariState.outputValue)} />
      <input value={inariState.outputValue} onChange={(e) => handleValuesChange(inariState.inputValue, e.target.value)} />
      <button onClick={() => handleStrategyChange({ inputToken: 'ETH', outputToken: 'DAI', exchangeRate: 1000 })}>Swap</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines the initial state and reducers for the InariState slice of the Redux store for the zoo project. It handles setting the strategy, zap in, and input/output values for the stakeSushiToBentoStrategy.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code imports functions and types from other files in the `zoo` project, including `actions.ts`, `types.ts`, and `useStakeSushiToBentoStrategy.ts`. It also imports `createReducer` from the `@reduxjs/toolkit` library.

3. What is the expected shape of the `InariState` object?
- The `InariState` object is expected to have an `id` string, a `zapIn` boolean, `inputValue` and `outputValue` strings, a `general` object with `inputSymbol` and `outputSymbol` strings, and a `tokens` object with `inputToken` and `outputToken` objects. The `tokens` object is defined by the `tokenDefinitions` array imported from `useStakeSushiToBentoStrategy.ts`.
