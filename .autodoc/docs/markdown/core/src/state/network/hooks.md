This code is a custom hook that utilizes the `useSelector` hook from the `react-redux` library to retrieve the current gas price from the `NetworkState` reducer. The `useGasPrice` hook can be used in any component that needs to access the gas price value from the Redux store.

The `useSelector` hook takes a selector function as its argument, which is used to extract a specific piece of state from the Redux store. In this case, the selector function takes the `NetworkState` object as its argument and returns the `gasPrice` value.

The `useGasPrice` hook returns the `gasPrice` value, which is either a number or `undefined`. This allows components to handle the case where the gas price has not yet been fetched or is not available.

Here is an example of how this hook can be used in a component:

```
import React from 'react'
import { useGasPrice } from './useGasPrice'

function GasPrice() {
  const gasPrice = useGasPrice()

  if (gasPrice === undefined) {
    return <div>Loading gas price...</div>
  }

  return <div>Current gas price: {gasPrice} Gwei</div>
}
```

In this example, the `GasPrice` component uses the `useGasPrice` hook to retrieve the current gas price from the Redux store. If the gas price is not yet available, the component displays a loading message. Otherwise, it displays the current gas price in Gwei units.

Overall, this code provides a simple and reusable way to access the gas price value from the Redux store in any component that needs it.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useSelector` hook from `react-redux` being used in this code?
   - The `useSelector` hook is used to extract data from the Redux store state, specifically the `gasPrice` value from the `NetworkState` reducer.

2. What is the expected return type of the `useGasPrice` function?
   - The expected return type of the `useGasPrice` function is either a number or `undefined`.

3. What is the `NetworkState` import and how is it used in this code?
   - The `NetworkState` import is likely a custom type or interface defined in the `reducer` file. It is used as the type for the `state` argument in the `useSelector` callback function to ensure type safety when accessing the `gasPrice` value from the Redux store state.
