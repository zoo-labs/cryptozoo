This file contains two functions that are used to derive stake and unstake information based on typed input values. These functions are exported for use in other parts of the project. 

The `useDerivedStakeInfo` function takes in three parameters: `typedValue`, `stakingToken`, and `userLiquidityUnstaked`. `typedValue` is a string representing the user's input value. `stakingToken` is a `Token` object representing the token being staked. `userLiquidityUnstaked` is a `CurrencyAmount` object representing the amount of unstaked liquidity the user has. 

The function first uses the `tryParseAmount` function to parse the `typedValue` into a `CurrencyAmount` object. If the parsing is successful and the parsed amount is less than or equal to the user's unstaked liquidity, the parsed amount is returned. Otherwise, the function returns `undefined`. 

The function also checks if the user is connected to a wallet and sets an error message accordingly. If the parsed amount is not valid, the error message is set to "Enter an amount". The function returns an object containing the parsed amount and error message. 

The `useDerivedUnstakeInfo` function takes in two parameters: `typedValue` and `stakingAmount`. `typedValue` is a string representing the user's input value. `stakingAmount` is a `CurrencyAmount` object representing the amount of liquidity being staked. 

The function first uses the `tryParseAmount` function to parse the `typedValue` into a `CurrencyAmount` object. If the parsing is successful and the parsed amount is less than or equal to the staked liquidity, the parsed amount is returned. Otherwise, the function returns `undefined`. 

The function also checks if the user is connected to a wallet and sets an error message accordingly. If the parsed amount is not valid, the error message is set to "Enter an amount". The function returns an object containing the parsed amount and error message. 

These functions are useful for validating user input and deriving stake and unstake information. They can be used in other parts of the project where stake and unstake functionality is required. For example, they could be used in a form where the user enters the amount they want to stake or unstake. The functions would validate the input and return the parsed amount or an error message.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code exports two functions, `useDerivedStakeInfo` and `useDerivedUnstakeInfo`, which are used to derive stake and unstake information respectively based on user input.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
   
   This code relies on several external dependencies, including `@zoolabs/zdk`, `@lingui/macro`, `../../functions`, and `../../hooks/useActiveWeb3React`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `useDerivedStakeInfo` and `useDerivedUnstakeInfo` functions?
   
   Both functions take a string `typedValue` as input, along with other optional parameters depending on the function. They return an object with two properties: `parsedAmount`, which is a `CurrencyAmount<Token>` object, and `error`, which is a string or undefined. The `parsedAmount` property is derived based on the input and other parameters, while the `error` property is set to a string if there is an error with the input or if the user is not connected to a wallet.
