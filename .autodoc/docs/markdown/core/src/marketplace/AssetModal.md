The `AssetModal` component is a React component that renders a modal window for displaying information about a digital asset. The component imports several other components and libraries, including `next/router`, `react-morphing-modal`, and `react-icons/hi`. The component also imports several other components from the same directory, including `Asset`, `HowReservations`, `SetBid`, `SetAsk`, `HowOffline`, `BidList`, `BidModal`, and `useAsset`.

The `AssetModal` component takes in a single prop, `props`, which is an object containing a `modalProps` property. The `modalProps` property is an object containing various properties that are passed down to the `Modal` component from the `react-morphing-modal` library. The `AssetModal` component also uses the `useRouter` hook from the `next/router` library to get the current URL and query parameters.

The `AssetModal` component renders a modal window with two columns. The left column displays information about the digital asset, including its content URI, current highest bid, and current lowest ask. The right column displays a list of bids and asks for the asset, as well as options for creating new bids and asks.

The `AssetModal` component uses the `useAsset` hook to get information about the digital asset, including its current highest bid, lowest ask, and content URI. The component also uses several state variables, including `tokenId`, `show`, `showBidModal`, and `modalBid`, to manage the state of the modal window.

The `AssetModal` component contains several helper components, including `NoBids`, `NoAsks`, and `BidModal`. The `NoBids` and `NoAsks` components are simple components that display a message when there are no bids or asks for the digital asset. The `BidModal` component is a modal window that displays information about a specific bid.

Overall, the `AssetModal` component is a key component in the `zoo` project that allows users to view and interact with digital assets. The component is highly modular and can be easily customized to fit the needs of different projects.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useRouter` hook and how is it used in this code?
- The `useRouter` hook is used to access the Next.js router object and retrieve query parameters from the URL. It is used in this code to retrieve the `tokenId` parameter from the URL query and set it as the state for the component.

2. What is the purpose of the `AssetModal` component and what are its props?
- The `AssetModal` component is a modal that displays information about a specific asset, including its price, bids, and reservations. Its props include `modalProps` (which are passed down from the parent component), `openModal` (a function that opens the modal), and any other custom props that may be passed down.

3. What is the purpose of the `BidModal` component and how is it used in this code?
- The `BidModal` component is a modal that displays information about a specific bid, including its amount and bidder. It is used in this code to display more information about a bid when a user clicks on it in the `BidList` component. The `BidModal` component is conditionally rendered based on the `showBidModal` state variable, and is passed the `bid` object and a function to close the modal as props.
