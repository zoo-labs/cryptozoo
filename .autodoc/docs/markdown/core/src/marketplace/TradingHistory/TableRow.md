The `TableRow` component is a reusable React component that renders a table row with four columns and a copy-to-clipboard button. The component takes four props, `ColA`, `ColB`, `ColC`, and `ColD`, which are used to populate the text content of the four columns. If any of these props are not provided, default values are used instead.

The first column of the table row contains an image of a checkmark and the text content of `ColA`. The second, third, and fourth columns contain the text content of `ColB`, `ColC`, and `ColD`, respectively. The fifth column contains a copy-to-clipboard button that, when clicked, copies the text content of `ColD` to the user's clipboard and displays a checkmark icon to indicate that the copy was successful.

The `TableRow` component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the `copied` variable, which is initially set to `false`. When the copy-to-clipboard button is clicked, the `copyToClipboard` function is called, which uses the `navigator.clipboard.writeText` method to write the text content of `ColD` to the user's clipboard. The `copied` variable is then set to `true`, which triggers a re-render of the component. During this re-render, the checkmark icon is displayed instead of the copy-to-clipboard icon.

The `TableRow` component also uses the `useEffect` hook to reset the `copied` variable to `false` after two seconds have elapsed since the copy-to-clipboard button was clicked. This ensures that the checkmark icon is only displayed briefly to indicate that the copy was successful, and then reverts back to the copy-to-clipboard icon.

This component can be used in any React project that requires a table with copy-to-clipboard functionality. It is highly customizable, as the text content of each column can be easily changed by passing in different props. Additionally, the styling of the component can be customized by modifying the CSS classes applied to each column. Here is an example of how the `TableRow` component can be used in a larger project:

```
import TableRow from './TableRow'

const MyTable = () => {
  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Column A</th>
          <th>Column B</th>
          <th>Column C</th>
          <th>Column D</th>
          <th>Actions</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <TableRow
          ColA="Row 1, Column A"
          ColB="Row 1, Column B"
          ColC="Row 1, Column C"
          ColD="Row 1, Column D"
        />
        <TableRow
          ColA="Row 2, Column A"
          ColB="Row 2, Column B"
          ColC="Row 2, Column C"
          ColD="Row 2, Column D"
        />
        <TableRow
          ColA="Row 3, Column A"
          ColB="Row 3, Column B"
          ColC="Row 3, Column C"
          ColD="Row 3, Column D"
        />
      </tbody>
    </table>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `TableRow` component?
- The `TableRow` component is used to render a table row with four columns and a copy-to-clipboard button.

2. What is the significance of the `copied` state variable?
- The `copied` state variable is used to keep track of whether the value in the fourth column has been copied to the clipboard or not.

3. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this component?
- The `useEffect` hook is used to reset the `copied` state variable to `false` after 2 seconds if it has been set to `true`. This is done to remove the "copied" checkmark icon after it has been displayed for a short period of time.
