The code defines a React component called `RemoveBidButton` that renders a button to remove a bid for a given token. The component takes in several props including `tokenId`, `tokenType`, `currency`, `onError`, and `onRemove`. 

The component uses several hooks including `useActiveWeb3React`, `useGasPrice`, and `useContract` to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. Specifically, it uses the `app` and `media` contracts to remove a bid for the given `tokenId`. If the `currency` is the native currency (e.g. Ether), it uses the `app` contract to remove the bid. Otherwise, it uses the `media` contract. 

If the removal of the bid is successful, the `onRemove` callback is called with the `tokenId`. If there is an error, the `onError` callback is called with the error. Additionally, the component uses the `useTransactionPopups` hook to display transaction popups for successful and failed transactions.

The component returns a button element with the text "Remove Bid" that calls the `removeBid` function when clicked. The `removeBid` function attempts to remove the bid using the appropriate contract and displays transaction popups or error popups as necessary.

This component can be used in a larger project that involves buying and selling tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It provides a simple way for users to remove their bids on tokens they are no longer interested in purchasing. Here is an example usage of the component:

```
<RemoveBidButton
  tokenId={123}
  tokenType="MyToken"
  currency="ETH"
  onRemove={(tokenId) => console.log(`Bid removed for token ${tokenId}`)}
  onError={(error) => console.error(error)}
/>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `RemoveBidButton` component?
- The `RemoveBidButton` component is used to render a button that, when clicked, removes a bid for a specific token.

2. What libraries or hooks are being imported and used in this file?
- The file imports `isNativeCurrency` from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, as well as `useCallback` from `react`, and `useActiveWeb3React`, `useContract`, `useGasPrice`, and `useTransactionPopups` from various custom hooks defined in other files.

3. What happens when the `removeBid` function is called?
- The `removeBid` function attempts to remove a bid for a specific token by calling either the `removeBid` function on the `app` contract or the `media` contract, depending on whether the `currency` parameter is a native currency or not. If successful, it calls the `onRemove` function with the `tokenId` parameter. If there is an error, it calls the `onError` function with the error parameter and displays an error popup.
