The code defines a React component called `AskList` that queries a GraphQL API for a list of "asks" and renders them as a list of `AskItem` components. An "ask" is a request to sell a digital asset (e.g. an NFT) for a certain amount of currency. 

The component takes several props: `where` is an object that can contain filters for the query (e.g. to only show asks for a certain media or owner), `empty` is an optional JSX element to render if there are no asks to display, and `showToken` is a boolean flag to determine whether to show the token symbol for the currency in addition to the amount. 

The component uses the `useQuery` hook from the `@apollo/client` library to fetch data from the GraphQL API. The query is defined using the `gql` template literal tag and requests the `id`, `amount`, `createdAtTimestamp`, `currency`, `owner`, and `media` fields for each ask. The `where` variable is passed as a parameter to the query and is used to filter the results based on the `media` and `owner` fields. The `fetchPolicy` option is set to `'no-cache'` to ensure that the query always hits the server instead of using cached data. The `pollInterval` option is set to `10000` (10 seconds) to refetch the data every 10 seconds.

The `usePrice` hook is used to get a function called `getUsdAmount`, which converts an amount of currency to its equivalent value in USD. The `useRouter` hook is used to get the current Next.js router instance, which is used to navigate to a new page when an `AskItem` is clicked.

The `asks` variable is set to the `data.asks` array returned by the query, or an empty array if there is no data. The `onClick` function is defined to navigate to a new page with the `tokenId` query parameter set to the ID of the media associated with the clicked `AskItem`.

The component renders a list of `AskItem` components for each ask in the `asks` array, passing in the `ask`, `getUsdAmount`, `showToken`, and `onClick` props. If there are no asks to display, the `empty` prop is rendered, or a default message is displayed if `empty` is not provided.

This component can be used in a larger project to display a list of asks for a particular digital asset marketplace. It provides filtering options and real-time updates via polling. The `AskItem` component can be customized to display additional information about each ask, such as the seller's username or the asset's image. The `getUsdAmount` function can be replaced with a different currency conversion function if needed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AskList` component?
- The `AskList` component is used to display a list of asks (offers to sell) for media items, with optional filtering and display options.

2. What is the `GET_ASKS` GraphQL query used for?
- The `GET_ASKS` query is used to fetch a list of asks from a GraphQL API, with optional filtering parameters.

3. What is the purpose of the `onClick` function in the `AskList` component?
- The `onClick` function is used to handle click events on an ask item, and navigate to a new page with additional query parameters based on the clicked item.
