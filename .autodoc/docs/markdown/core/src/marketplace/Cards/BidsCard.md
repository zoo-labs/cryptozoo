The `BidsCard` component is a React component that renders a card displaying information about an auction. The component takes in several props, including `glb`, `usdz`, `itemId`, `ownerAdd`, `CurrentBid`, `StartingBid`, `greenNum`, `AuctionTime`, `typeOfNft`, and `bid`. 

The component uses the `useRouter` hook from the `next/router` module to handle navigation to other pages in the application. It also uses two custom hooks, `useEditAuctionModalToggle` and `useIncreaseBidModalToggle`, from the `state/application/hooks` module to toggle the visibility of modals for editing auctions and increasing bids, respectively.

The component renders two columns of information. The left column displays a 3D model of the item being auctioned using the `ModelViewer` component from the `../../components/ModelViewer` module. The right column displays information about the auction, including the type of NFT being auctioned, the owner's address, the current bid, the reserve price, the time remaining in the auction, and buttons for editing the auction or increasing the bid.

The `handleFunc` function is called when the user clicks on one of the buttons. If the `bid` prop is `true`, the function toggles the visibility of the "increase bid" modal using the `toggleIncreaseBidModal` function. Otherwise, it toggles the visibility of the "edit auction" modal using the `toggleEditAuctionModal` function.

Overall, the `BidsCard` component provides a reusable way to display information about auctions in the larger project. Developers can use this component to render auction information on various pages throughout the application. For example, the component could be used on a marketplace page to display information about items currently up for auction. 

Example usage:

```
import BidsCard from "zoo/components/BidsCard";

function AuctionPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <BidsCard
        glb="..."
        usdz="..."
        itemId={1}
        ownerAdd="8xbxbddb"
        CurrentBid={3}
        StartingBid={2}
        greenNum="10200"
        AuctionTime="6:20:00"
        typeOfNft="Egg"
        bid={true}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `BidsCard` component?
- The `BidsCard` component is used to display information about an auction item, including its image, owner, current and starting bid, auction time, and type of NFT. It also includes buttons to increase the bid or edit the auction, as well as a button to view the item or bid.

2. What is the purpose of the `ModelViewer` component?
- The `ModelViewer` component is imported from `../../components/ModelViewer` and is used to display a 3D model of the auction item. It is wrapped in a `div` with a fixed width and height and a rounded border.

3. What are the `useEditAuctionModalToggle` and `useIncreaseBidModalToggle` hooks used for?
- These hooks are imported from `state/application/hooks` and are used to toggle the visibility of the "Edit Auction" and "Increase Bid" modals, respectively. They are called when the corresponding button is clicked in the `handleFunc` function, which checks whether the `bid` prop is true or false.
