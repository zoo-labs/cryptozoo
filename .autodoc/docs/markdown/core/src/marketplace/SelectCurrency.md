The code above is a React component that renders a list of supported payment currencies for a given blockchain network. It imports the `useActiveWeb3React` hook from a `hooks` module and the `getSupportedPaymentCurrencies` function from a `config/currencies` module. It also imports a `CurrencyLogo` component from a local file.

The `SelectCurrency` component takes a single prop called `onSelect`, which is a callback function that will be called when a currency is selected. The component first calls the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to get the current blockchain network's ID. It then renders a list of buttons, each representing a supported currency for the current network. The list is generated by mapping over the result of calling `getSupportedPaymentCurrencies` with the current network's ID as an argument.

Each button has an `onClick` handler that calls the `onSelect` callback with the selected currency as an argument. The button also renders a `CurrencyLogo` component and the currency symbol in a `div` element. The `CurrencyLogo` component takes the currency symbol as a prop and renders the corresponding logo.

This component can be used in a larger project that requires users to select a payment currency for a transaction. The `onSelect` callback can be used to update the selected currency in the parent component's state or trigger an action. The `getSupportedPaymentCurrencies` function can be modified to support additional blockchain networks or currencies. The `CurrencyLogo` component can be reused in other parts of the project that require currency logos. 

Example usage:

```
import SelectCurrency from './SelectCurrency'

const PaymentForm = () => {
  const [selectedCurrency, setSelectedCurrency] = useState(null)

  const handleCurrencySelect = (currency) => {
    setSelectedCurrency(currency)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <SelectCurrency onSelect={handleCurrencySelect} />
      <p>Selected currency: {selectedCurrency ? selectedCurrency.symbol : 'None'}</p>
      {/* rest of payment form */}
    </div>
  )
}
```
