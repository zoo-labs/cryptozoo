The `NftRight` component in the `zoo` project is a React component that renders a right-hand side panel for displaying details about a non-fungible token (NFT). The component takes in several props, including `NftText`, `NftName`, `transaction`, `TokenId`, `Hash`, and `TokenStandard`, which are used to populate the various fields in the panel.

The panel is divided into two sections: "Details" and "Proof of Authenticity". The "Details" section displays information about the NFT, including the transaction ID, token ID, hash, and token standard. Each piece of information is displayed in a grid format with the label on the left and the value on the right. The "Proof of Authenticity" section displays the price of the NFT in $zoo, as well as links to view the transaction on Ether Scan and IPFs.

The component uses Tailwind CSS classes to style the panel, including setting the width to 300px on small screens and 400px on large screens. The panel also has a gradient border and a black background.

This component can be used in a larger project that involves displaying NFTs and their associated details. For example, it could be used in an NFT marketplace or a digital art gallery. The component could be reused throughout the project to display NFT details in a consistent and visually appealing way. Here is an example of how the component could be used in a larger React application:

```
import React from 'react';
import NftRight from './NftRight';

const NftDetails = () => {
  return (
    <div className="flex">
      <div className="w-1/2">
        {/* Display NFT image and other details */}
      </div>
      <div className="w-1/2">
        <NftRight
          NftText="To hatch or to hold..."
          NftName="Egg#4"
          transaction="8xx902xcbx93.."
          TokenId="43"
          Hash="8xbsxbc9"
          TokenStandard="ERC-721"
        />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default NftDetails;
```

In this example, the `NftDetails` component displays an NFT image and other details on the left-hand side of the screen, and the `NftRight` component is used to display additional details about the NFT on the right-hand side of the screen. By using the `NftRight` component, the project can ensure that NFT details are displayed consistently throughout the application.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this component and how is it used in the project?
   - This component is used to display details and information about a specific NFT (non-fungible token) and its transaction history. It can be used in a larger application that involves buying, selling, or trading NFTs.
2. What are the default values for the props passed to this component?
   - The default values for the props are: NftText = 'To hatch or to hold...', NftName = 'Egg#4', transaction = '8xx902xcbx93..', TokenId = '43', Hash = '8xbsxbc9', TokenStandard = 'ERC-721'. These values will be used if the props are not explicitly passed to the component.
3. What is the purpose of the "borderGrad" class and where is it defined?
   - The "borderGrad" class is used to apply a gradient border to the div elements that contain the NFT details and proof of authenticity. It is not defined in this file and must be defined elsewhere in the project's CSS or styling files.
