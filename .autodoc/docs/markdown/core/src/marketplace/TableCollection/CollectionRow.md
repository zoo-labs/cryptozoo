The `CollectionRow` component is a reusable React component that renders a table row with six columns. The purpose of this component is to provide a consistent layout for displaying data in a table format. The component takes in six optional props (`ColARank`, `ColA`, `ColB`, `ColC`, `ColD`, and `ColE`) that can be used to customize the content of each column. If a prop is not provided, a default value is used.

The component uses the `tr` and `td` HTML tags to create the table row and columns, respectively. The `className` attribute is used to apply CSS classes to each element, which control the styling of the table. The `flex` class is used to make the first column (`ColARank`) and the second column (`ColA`) appear side-by-side.

Here is an example of how the `CollectionRow` component can be used:

```
import CollectionRow from './CollectionRow'

function MyTable() {
  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Rank</th>
          <th>Column A</th>
          <th>Column B</th>
          <th>Column C</th>
          <th>Column D</th>
          <th>Column E</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <CollectionRow
          ColARank="1"
          ColA="Data 1"
          ColB="Data 2"
          ColC="Data 3"
          ColD="Data 4"
          ColE="Data 5"
          ColF="Data 6"
        />
        <CollectionRow
          ColARank="2"
          ColA="Data 7"
          ColB="Data 8"
          ColC="Data 9"
          ColD="Data 10"
          ColE="Data 11"
          ColF="Data 12"
        />
      </tbody>
    </table>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `CollectionRow` component is used to render two rows of data in a table. The `ColARank`, `ColA`, `ColB`, `ColC`, `ColD`, `ColE`, and `ColF` props are used to customize the content of each column. The resulting table will have a consistent layout and styling, making it easier to read and understand the data.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code defines a React component called `CollectionRow` that renders a table row with cells that can be customized using props.

2. What are the default values for the props used in this component?
   - The default values for the props are: `ColARank` is `'1'`, `ColA` is `'Use Prop "ColA" To Change '`, `ColB` is `'Use Prop "ColB" To Change '`, `ColC` is `'Use Prop "ColC" To Change '`, `ColD` is `'Use Prop "ColD" To Change '`, `ColE` is `'Use Prop "ColC" To Change'`, and `ColF` is `'Use Prop "ColF" To Change'`.

3. What CSS classes are applied to the table cells in this component?
   - The table cells have the following CSS classes applied to them: `text-xs md:text-base  text-left`, `bg-[#1F2030]`, `p-4`, `border-b`, and `border-opacity-5`.
