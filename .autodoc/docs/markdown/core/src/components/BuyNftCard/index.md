The code defines a React component called `BuyNftCard` that renders a card displaying information about a non-fungible token (NFT) for sale. The component takes in several props, including an image, name, address, price, days, yields, and currency. 

The `image` prop is a React node that represents the image of the NFT. The `name` prop is a string that represents the name of the NFT. The `address` prop is a string that represents the address of the NFT. The `price` prop is a string that represents the price of the NFT. The `days` prop is a string that represents the number of days left for the NFT sale. The `yields` prop is a string that represents the yield of the NFT. The `currency` prop is a string that represents the currency used for the price of the NFT. 

The component renders a div that contains the NFT image and information about the NFT. The NFT image is displayed using the `image` prop. The NFT information is displayed using the `name`, `address`, `price`, `days`, `yields`, and `currency` props. The NFT name is displayed using the `name` prop. The NFT address is displayed using the `address` prop. The NFT price and currency are displayed using the `price` and `currency` props. The NFT days left is displayed using the `days` prop. The NFT yield is displayed using the `yields` prop. 

The component is exported as the default export of the module, which means it can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, if there is a page that displays a list of NFTs for sale, the `BuyNftCard` component can be used to render each NFT card. 

Example usage:

```
import BuyNftCard from "./BuyNftCard";

const nft = {
  image: <img src="nft-image.png" />,
  name: "Cool NFT",
  address: "0x1234567890abcdef",
  price: "1.23",
  days: "5",
  yields: "10%",
  currency: "ETH",
};

const NftCardPage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <BuyNftCard {...nft} />
    </div>
  );
};
```
