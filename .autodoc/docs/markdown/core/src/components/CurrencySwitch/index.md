The code above is a React component that exports a switch button that toggles between two currencies, ZOO and BNB. The switch button is styled using Material UI's `styled` function and is composed of three main parts: the switch base, the switch thumb, and the switch track. 

The switch base is the underlying structure of the switch button and is styled to have a width of 80 pixels, a height of 40 pixels, and no padding. The switch thumb is the circular button that moves along the switch track when the switch is toggled. The switch thumb is styled to have a width and height of 32 pixels, a background image of the Zoo logo, and a white background color. The switch track is the bar that the switch thumb moves along when the switch is toggled. The switch track is styled to have a border radius of 20 pixels and a dark background color.

The `CurrencySwitch` component takes two props: `checked` and `checkFunc`. `checked` is a boolean that determines whether the switch is toggled or not, and `checkFunc` is a function that is called when the switch is toggled. The `CurrencySwitch` component renders a `FormGroup` component that contains a `Stack` component with three child components: two `h6` elements that display the currency names and the `UiSwitch` component that is the styled switch button. 

This component can be used in a larger project that requires a switch button to toggle between two options. For example, in a cryptocurrency trading app, this switch button can be used to toggle between two currencies that the user wants to trade. 

Example usage:

```
import CurrencySwitch from './CurrencySwitch'

function TradingPage() {
  const [isZooSelected, setIsZooSelected] = useState(true)

  const handleCurrencyToggle = () => {
    setIsZooSelected(!isZooSelected)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Trading Page</h1>
      <CurrencySwitch checked={isZooSelected} checkFunc={handleCurrencyToggle} />
      <p>{isZooSelected ? 'ZOO' : 'BNB'} selected</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In the example above, the `TradingPage` component renders the `CurrencySwitch` component and a paragraph that displays the currently selected currency. The `TradingPage` component also has a state variable `isZooSelected` that determines whether the ZOO currency is selected or not. The `handleCurrencyToggle` function is called when the switch button is toggled and updates the `isZooSelected` state variable.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code exports a React component called `CurrencySwitch` that renders a switch with two labels, "ZOO" and "BNB", and an image of a zoo logo.

2. What is the significance of the `styled` function from `@mui/material/styles`?
   The `styled` function is used to create a custom styled component based on the `Switch` component from `@mui/material/Switch`. The custom component is called `UiSwitch` and has specific styles applied to it.

3. What are the props accepted by the `CurrencySwitch` component?
   The `CurrencySwitch` component accepts two props: `checked`, a boolean value that determines whether the switch is checked or not, and `checkFunc`, a function that is called when the switch is toggled.
