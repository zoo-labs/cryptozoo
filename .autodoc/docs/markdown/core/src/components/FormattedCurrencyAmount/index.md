This code is a module that exports a React component called `FormattedCurrencyAmount`. The component takes in two props: `currencyAmount` and `significantDigits`. The `currencyAmount` prop is an object of type `CurrencyAmount` that represents a certain amount of a specific currency. The `significantDigits` prop is an optional number that determines how many significant digits should be displayed in the output.

The component first defines a constant called `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` which is a `Fraction` object representing the minimum amount of currency that can be displayed. This is set to 1/1000000.

The component then returns a JSX expression that displays the formatted currency amount. If the `currencyAmount` prop is equal to 0, the component displays "0". If the `currencyAmount` prop is greater than the `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` constant, the component displays the currency amount with the number of significant digits specified by the `significantDigits` prop. If the `currencyAmount` prop is less than or equal to the `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` constant, the component displays "<" followed by the `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` constant formatted with 1 significant digit.

This component can be used in a larger project that deals with currencies and requires a way to format currency amounts for display. For example, if the project has a shopping cart feature that displays the total cost of items in the cart, this component can be used to format the currency amount for display. 

Example usage:

```
import { Currency, CurrencyAmount } from "@zoolabs/zdk";
import FormattedCurrencyAmount from "./FormattedCurrencyAmount";

const currencyAmount = new CurrencyAmount(Currency.USD, "1000000000000000000");

function ShoppingCartTotal() {
  return (
    <div>
      Total: <FormattedCurrencyAmount currencyAmount={currencyAmount} significantDigits={2} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `FormattedCurrencyAmount` component is used to format the `currencyAmount` object with 2 significant digits for display in a shopping cart total.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `@zoolabs/zdk` import?
- The `@zoolabs/zdk` import is used to import the `Currency`, `CurrencyAmount`, `Fraction`, and `JSBI` modules from the `zdk` library.

2. What is the significance of the `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` constant?
- The `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN` constant represents the minimum amount of currency that can be displayed and is set to 1/1000000th of the currency unit.

3. What does the `FormattedCurrencyAmount` function do?
- The `FormattedCurrencyAmount` function takes in a `currencyAmount` object and an optional `significantDigits` parameter and returns a formatted string representation of the currency amount. If the amount is equal to 0, it returns "0". If the amount is greater than the `CURRENCY_AMOUNT_MIN`, it returns the amount formatted to the specified number of significant digits. Otherwise, it returns a string indicating that the amount is less than the minimum displayable amount.
