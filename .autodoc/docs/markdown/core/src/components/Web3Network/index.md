The `Web3Network` component is a React component that displays the current Ethereum network that the user is connected to and allows them to switch to a different network. The component imports the `NETWORK_ICON` and `NETWORK_LABEL` constants from a configuration file located in the `config/networks` directory. These constants are used to display the icon and label for the current network.

The component also imports the `Image` component from the `next/image` library, which is used to display the network icon. It also imports the `NetworkModal` component from the `modals/NetworkModal` directory, which is used to display a modal that allows the user to switch to a different network.

The `useActiveWeb3React` hook is used to get the current chain ID of the user's Ethereum network. If the chain ID is not available, the component returns `null` and does not render anything.

If the chain ID is available, the component renders a div that displays the current network icon and label. The div is clickable and when clicked, it calls the `toggleNetworkModal` function, which is defined using the `useNetworkModalToggle` hook. This function opens the `NetworkModal` component, which allows the user to switch to a different network.

Overall, this component is a small but important part of the larger project that allows users to interact with the Ethereum network. It provides a simple and intuitive way for users to switch between different networks, which is a crucial feature for many Ethereum applications. Here is an example of how this component can be used in a larger React application:

```jsx
import Web3Network from './components/Web3Network'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Web3Network />
      {/* other components */}
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code is a React component that renders a network switcher UI element for a web3 application.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several dependencies including `next/image`, `react`, and custom hooks and components from other files in the project.

3. What is the expected behavior when the user interacts with this UI element?
- When the user clicks on the network switcher UI element, a modal component called `NetworkModal` is displayed, allowing the user to select a different network to connect to.
