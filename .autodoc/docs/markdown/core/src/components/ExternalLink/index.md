The `ExternalLink` component in this file is a reusable React component that renders an anchor tag (`<a>`) with some additional functionality. It takes in several props, including `href` (the URL to link to), `target` (the target window or frame to open the link in), `rel` (the relationship between the current document and the linked document), `color` (the color scheme to use for the link), `startIcon` and `endIcon` (optional icons to display before or after the link text), and any other props that can be passed to an anchor tag.

When the link is clicked, the `handleClick` function is called. If the link is set to open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) or if the user is holding down the Ctrl or Command key, the link is opened normally and an outbound link event is tracked using the `ReactGA` library. If the link is set to open in the same tab (`target="_self"`) and the user is not holding down any modifier keys, the default behavior of the anchor tag is prevented, an outbound link event is tracked using `ReactGA`, and the page is redirected to the linked URL.

The `COLOR` object defines two color schemes for the link: `default` and `blue`. These color schemes are used to set the text color and opacity of the link based on whether it is being hovered over or focused on.

This component can be used throughout the larger project to create links that track outbound link events using `ReactGA`. It provides a consistent and customizable way to render external links with additional functionality. Here's an example of how it could be used:

```jsx
import ExternalLink from "./path/to/ExternalLink";

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ExternalLink href="https://example.com" color="blue">
        Click me!
      </ExternalLink>
    </div>
  );
}
```
