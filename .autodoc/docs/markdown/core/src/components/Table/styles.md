This code defines a styled table component using the styled-components library. The purpose of this code is to create a reusable table component that can be used throughout the larger project. 

The `Table` component is defined as a styled `table` element with various CSS properties applied to it. These properties include setting the font family to Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif, collapsing the borders, setting the width to 100%, and hiding any overflow. 

The `td` and `th` elements within the table are also styled with a bottom border and padding of 16px, with additional padding on the left for `td` elements. The `th` elements have a background color of #333333, white text color, and additional padding on the top and bottom. 

This component can be used in various parts of the project where a table is needed. For example, it can be used to display a list of animals in the zoo, their names, and their habitats. 

To use this component, it can be imported into the desired file and used as a regular React component. For example:

```
import { Table } from 'zoo';

function AnimalList() {
  return (
    <Table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Name</th>
          <th>Habitat</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>Lion</td>
          <td>Africa</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Panda</td>
          <td>Asia</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </Table>
  );
}
```

This would render a table with two columns, "Name" and "Habitat", and two rows with the animal names and their habitats. Overall, this code provides a simple and reusable way to style tables in the larger project.
