The `ModelViewer` component is a React component that renders a 3D model viewer using the `model-viewer` library from Google. The component takes several props, including the paths to the GLB and USDZ files for the 3D model, the zoom level, and a boolean flag for whether to use the USDZ file. The component also includes a list of animal models that can be used as the current 3D model.

The component renders a `div` element that contains the `model-viewer` element, which is created using a template string that includes the props passed to the component. The `model-viewer` element includes several attributes that control its behavior, such as `loading`, `reveal`, `camera-controls`, `auto-rotate`, `autoplay`, and `ar`. These attributes enable features such as automatic rotation, autoplay, and augmented reality (AR) support.

The `useEffect` hook is used to perform any necessary cleanup when the component is unmounted, but it does not currently have any functionality.

The `ModelViewer` component can be used in a larger project to display 3D models of animals or other objects. For example, it could be used in an educational app to teach children about different animals, or in an e-commerce app to allow customers to view products in 3D. The component could be customized by passing different props, such as different 3D models or zoom levels, to suit the needs of the specific use case.

Example usage:

```
import ModelViewer from "./ModelViewer";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>3D Animal Viewer</h1>
      <ModelViewer glb="/models/Wolf/WOLF.glb" usdz="/models/Wolf/WOLF.usdz" />
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   
   This code defines a React component called `ModelViewer` that renders a 3D model using the `model-viewer` library. The component takes in several props that allow customization of the model and its behavior.

2. What are the default values for the props of this component?
   
   The default values for the props are as follows:
   - `glb`: "/models/Tiger/TIGER_BABY.glb"
   - `usdz`: "/models/Tiger/TIGER_BABY.usdz"
   - `zoom`: "auto"
   - `usdzFile`: false
   - `multiple`: false
   - `onClick`: () => {}
   - `className`: ""

3. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?
   
   The `useEffect` hook is currently empty and serves no purpose. It is likely included as a placeholder for future code that may need to be executed when the component mounts or unmounts.
