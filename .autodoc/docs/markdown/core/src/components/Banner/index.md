The `Banner` component is a React functional component that displays a banner at the top of the screen. The banner can be of two types: "default" or "network_migration". The default banner displays a link to a BSC Scan page, while the network_migration banner displays a link to migrate the network to get new tokens. 

The component imports several other components and hooks from the project, including `XIcon` from `@heroicons/react/outline`, `Copy` from `components/AccountDetails/Copy`, `Typography` from `components/Typography`, `useNetworkMigrationModalToggle` from `state/application/hooks`, and `NetworkMigrationModal` from `modals/NetworkMigrationModal`.

The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the `showBanner` variable, which determines whether the banner is displayed or not. The `toggleNetworkMigrationModal` function is used to toggle the state of the network migration modal.

The component returns a fragment that conditionally renders the banner based on the value of `showBanner` and the `type` prop. If `showBanner` is true and `type` is "network_migration", the component renders a banner with a link to migrate the network. If `showBanner` is true and `type` is "default", the component renders a banner with a link to a BSC Scan page. If `showBanner` is false, the component does not render anything.

The banner is styled using Tailwind CSS classes, and includes an X icon that can be clicked to dismiss the banner. The `NetworkMigrationModal` component is also rendered at the bottom of the banner.

This component can be used in the larger project to display important information or calls to action at the top of the screen. The `type` prop can be used to customize the content of the banner based on the context in which it is used. The `showBanner` state can be controlled by other components or hooks to show or hide the banner based on certain conditions.
