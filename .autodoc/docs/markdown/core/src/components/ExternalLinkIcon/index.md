The code above is a React component that renders an external link icon with some additional functionality. The component takes in several props, including the `target` attribute, `href` attribute, and `rel` attribute. The `target` attribute specifies where to open the linked document, while the `href` attribute specifies the URL of the linked document. The `rel` attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document.

The component also uses the `ReactGA` library to track outbound link clicks. When the link is clicked, the `handleClick` function is called. If the link is set to open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`) or if the user is holding down the `ctrl` or `meta` key, the link is opened in a new tab and a GA event is tracked. If the link is not set to open in a new tab, the default behavior is prevented, a GA event is tracked, and the user is redirected to the linked document.

The component returns an anchor tag with the appropriate attributes and event handlers. The `ExternalLink` component from the `react-feather` library is also rendered within the anchor tag to display the external link icon.

This component can be used throughout the larger project to render external links with consistent styling and tracking functionality. For example, it could be used in a navigation menu to link to external resources or in a list of related links at the bottom of a page. Here is an example usage of the component:

```
<ExternalLinkIcon href="https://www.example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" />
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a React component called `ExternalLinkIcon` that renders an anchor tag with an external link icon and tracks clicks on the link using ReactGA.

2. What are the required props for the `ExternalLinkIcon` component?
   
   The only required prop for the `ExternalLinkIcon` component is `href`, which is a string representing the URL of the external link.

3. What is the significance of the `ReactGA` library in this code?
   
   The `ReactGA` library is used to track clicks on the external link. It sends an event to Google Analytics with the label of the clicked link and triggers a location change if the link is not opened in a new tab.
