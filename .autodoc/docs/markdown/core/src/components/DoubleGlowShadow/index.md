The `DoubleGlowShadow` component is a React functional component that conditionally renders a double glow shadow effect around its children. The component imports the `isMobile` function from the `react-device-detect` library and the `FC` type from the `react` library. It also imports the `classNames` function from a `functions` module located in a parent directory.

The `DoubleGlowShadow` component takes in two props: `className` and `children`. The `className` prop is optional and is used to add additional CSS classes to the component. The `children` prop is also optional and represents the children components that will be wrapped by the `DoubleGlowShadow` component.

The component first checks if the `isMobile` function returns `true`. If it does, the component returns a div with a class of `shadow-swap` that wraps the `children` prop. This div does not have any shadow effects.

If the `isMobile` function returns `false`, the component returns a div that has three child divs. The first and second child divs are positioned absolutely and have a background color of blue and pink respectively. They are positioned on opposite sides of the parent div and have a width of 3/5 of the parent div's width. They also have a rounded border and a z-index of 0. These two divs create the double glow effect.

The third child div is positioned relatively and has a CSS filter of `drop-shadow`. This creates a shadow effect around the `children` prop. The `children` prop is wrapped by this div.

The `DoubleGlowShadow` component can be used in a larger project to add a double glow shadow effect around components. It can be used to highlight important components or to add a visual effect to a page. Here is an example of how the component can be used:

```
import DoubleGlowShadow from "./components/DoubleGlowShadow";

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <DoubleGlowShadow>
        <h1>Hello World</h1>
      </DoubleGlowShadow>
    </div>
  );
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `react-device-detect` library being imported?
- The `react-device-detect` library is being used to check if the user is on a mobile device or not.

2. What is the purpose of the `DoubleGlowShadow` component?
- The `DoubleGlowShadow` component is used to add a double glow shadow effect to its child components. If the user is on a mobile device, it will display a different shadow effect.

3. What is the purpose of the `classNames` function being imported from "../../functions"?
- The `classNames` function is being used to concatenate multiple class names together for the `className` prop of the `div` element being returned by the `DoubleGlowShadow` component.
