This code defines a `Typography` component that can be used to render text with different styles and weights. The component takes in several props, including `variant`, `weight`, `component`, `className`, and `clickable`. 

The `variant` prop determines the size of the text and can be set to one of several predefined values, including `hero`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `lg`, `base`, `sm`, and `xs`. The `weight` prop determines the font weight and can be set to either `400` or `700`. The `component` prop determines the HTML element that the text should be rendered as and defaults to `div`. The `className` prop allows for additional CSS classes to be added to the component. The `clickable` prop determines whether the text should be clickable or not.

The `Typography` component uses the `classNames` function from the `functions` module to generate a list of CSS classes based on the props passed in. It then creates a new React element using the `React.createElement` function and passes in the generated CSS classes, `onClick` handler (if provided), and any other props passed in. Finally, it renders the `children` prop, which represents the text to be displayed.

This component can be used throughout the larger project to render text with consistent styles and weights. For example, it could be used to render headings, paragraphs, or buttons. Here is an example of how the `Typography` component could be used to render a heading:

```
<Typography variant="h1" weight={700}>Welcome to the Zoo</Typography>
```

This would render the text "Welcome to the Zoo" as an `h1` element with a font weight of 700.
## Questions: 
 1. What are the possible values for the `TypographyVariant` and `TypographyWeight` types?
- The `TypographyVariant` type can have values of `'hero'`, `'h1'`, `'h2'`, `'h3'`, `'lg'`, `'base'`, `'sm'`, and `'xs'`. The `TypographyWeight` type can have values of `400` or `700`.

2. What is the purpose of the `classNames` function imported from `../../functions`?
- It is unclear from this code snippet what the `classNames` function does, but it is likely used to concatenate multiple class names together for the `className` prop of the `Typography` component.

3. What is the purpose of the `clickable` prop in the `TypographyProps` interface?
- The `clickable` prop is used to determine whether or not the `Typography` component should have a `cursor-pointer` class and `select-none` class added to its `className` prop, as well as whether or not to include an `onClick` prop.
