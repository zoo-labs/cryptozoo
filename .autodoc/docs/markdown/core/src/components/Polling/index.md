This code defines a React component called `Polling` that displays the current block number of a specified Ethereum chain and a spinning animation. The block number is obtained using the `useBlockNumber` hook from the `application` state, which is provided by the `useActiveWeb3React` hook. The `chainId` is also obtained from `useActiveWeb3React`. 

The component uses the `useState` hook to keep track of whether it is mounted or not. The `useEffect` hook is used to set a timer that updates the `isMounted` state variable every second. This is done to prevent a memory leak when the component is unmounted. The timer is cleared when the component is unmounted using the `clearTimeout` function.

The `ExternalLink` component is used to wrap the block number and spinning animation. The `href` attribute of the `ExternalLink` is set to a link to the block explorer for the specified chain and block number. If either the `chainId` or `blockNumber` is not available, the `href` attribute is set to an empty string. The `className` attribute of the `ExternalLink` is set to either `text-high-emphesis` or `text-low-emphesis` depending on the value of `isMounted`. 

The block number is displayed using a `div` element, and the spinning animation is displayed using an SVG element. The `animate-spin` class is added to the SVG element when `isMounted` is `true`, causing the animation to spin. 

This component can be used in a larger project to display the current block number of a specified Ethereum chain and provide a link to the block explorer for that block. It can be used in conjunction with other components to build a dashboard or monitoring tool for Ethereum applications. 

Example usage:

```
import Polling from './Polling'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Polling />
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code is a React component called `Polling` that renders a link with a block number and a spinning animation. The link points to a blockchain explorer and the block number is obtained from the `useBlockNumber` hook.

2. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?
- The `useEffect` hook is used to set a timer that updates the `isMounted` state after 1 second. It also clears the timer and sets `isMounted` to false when the component unmounts. The `useEffect` hook is triggered whenever the `blockNumber` changes.

3. What are the dependencies of this component?
- This component depends on the `React` library, the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks from React, the `ExternalLink` component from a relative path, the `getExplorerLink` function from a `functions/explorer` module, and the `useActiveWeb3React` and `useBlockNumber` hooks from `hooks/useActiveWeb3React` and `state/application/hooks` modules, respectively.
