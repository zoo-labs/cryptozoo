The `BuyEggSection` component is a React functional component that renders a section of the Zoo project's user interface. The section displays a list of available eggs for purchase, which are used to mint NFT animals. The component imports several dependencies, including icons from the Heroicons library, a custom loader component, and a Next.js `Link` component. 

The component uses several hooks to manage state and data fetching. The `useGif` hook is used to access the global state of the project's GIF mode. The `useSelector` hook is used to access the `availableEggs` property of the Redux store, which contains an array of egg objects. The `useGetAvailableEggs` hook is used to fetch the available eggs from the project's backend API. Finally, the `useZooKeeper` hook is used to access the current user's zookeeper object.

The component renders a header and a paragraph of text that provide information about the available eggs. If the `isLoadingEggs` state variable is true, the component renders a custom loader component. Otherwise, the component renders a grid of egg objects, each of which contains an animation of the egg and a button that links to the egg's marketplace page. 

The egg objects are rendered using the `availableEggs` array, which is mapped over to create a new array of egg components. Each egg component contains a `div` element that displays the egg's animation, which is rendered using a `video` element. The egg component also contains a button that links to the egg's marketplace page. 

Overall, the `BuyEggSection` component provides a user-friendly interface for purchasing eggs and minting NFT animals in the Zoo project. The component is designed to be reusable and can be easily integrated into other parts of the project's user interface.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useGif` hook and how is it used in this code?
   - The `useGif` hook is imported from a context called `GifContext` and is used to access the `gifMode` property from the context's state.
2. What is the significance of the `isLoadingEggs` state variable and how is it used?
   - `isLoadingEggs` is a boolean state variable that is used to conditionally render a loading spinner while the `getAvailableEggs` function is fetching data.
3. What is the purpose of the `CustomLoader` component and when is it rendered?
   - The `CustomLoader` component is a loading spinner that is rendered when `isLoadingEggs` is true, indicating that the `getAvailableEggs` function is fetching data.
