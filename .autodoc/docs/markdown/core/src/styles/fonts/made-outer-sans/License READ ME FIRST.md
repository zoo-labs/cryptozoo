This code is not actually a part of the zoo project, but rather a license agreement for a typeface created by MadeType. The purpose of this code is to provide information about the terms and conditions of using the typeface, as well as contact information for the creator. 

The code includes links to various websites where the typeface can be purchased, indicating that it is available for commercial use. However, the license agreement states that before using the typeface for commercial purposes, the user must contact MadeType to obtain permission. This suggests that the creator may have specific requirements or restrictions for commercial use.

The license agreement also includes a disclaimer stating that MadeType is not liable for any damage resulting from the use of the typeface. This is a common practice in the design industry, as it protects the creator from any legal issues that may arise from the use of their work.

Overall, this code serves as an important legal document for anyone who wishes to use the MadeType typeface. It outlines the terms and conditions of use, as well as contact information for the creator. By including this license agreement, MadeType is able to protect their work and ensure that it is used appropriately. 

Example usage:

If a designer wants to use the MadeType typeface for a commercial project, they would need to contact MadeType at the provided email address to obtain permission. They would also need to ensure that they follow the terms and conditions outlined in the license agreement, such as giving credit to the creator and not using the typeface in any way that could be considered harmful or offensive.
