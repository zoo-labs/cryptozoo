The `AssetList` component is a React component that renders a list of assets. It takes in several props, including `title`, `tokenType`, `tokenName`, `totalMinted`, `perPage`, `cols`, `where`, `orderBy`, `className`, `autoPlay`, `showPageNumbers`, `animate`, `large`, `empty`, `getTriggerProps`, `onLoadAssets`, and `openModal`. 

The component uses the `useQuery` hook from the `@apollo/client` library to fetch data from a GraphQL API. The query is defined using the `gql` template literal tag and is stored in the `GET_ASSETS` constant. The query fetches a list of assets based on the `where`, `skip`, `first`, and `orderBy` variables passed in as arguments. 

The `AssetList` component renders a grid of `Asset` components, which are defined in a separate file. Each `Asset` component represents a single asset and displays its image, name, and other relevant information. The `AssetList` component also includes pagination controls that allow the user to navigate between pages of assets. 

The `getPages` function is a utility function that takes in the total number of items and the number of items per page and returns an array of page sizes. This function is used to calculate the total number of pages based on the `totalMinted` and `perPage` props passed in to the `AssetList` component. 

The `Empty` component is a simple component that displays a message when the asset list is empty. It takes in an `empty` prop that can be used to customize the message. 

Overall, the `AssetList` component is a reusable component that can be used to display a list of assets in a grid format with pagination controls. It is highly customizable and can be used in a variety of contexts. Here is an example of how the `AssetList` component might be used in a larger project:

```jsx
import AssetList from "./AssetList";

const MyPage = () => {
  const where = { owner: "0x123abc" };
  const orderBy = "createdAt_DESC";
  const perPage = 12;

  return (
    <div>
      <AssetList
        title="My Assets"
        where={where}
        orderBy={orderBy}
        perPage={perPage}
        cols={4}
        showPageNumbers={false}
      />
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, the `AssetList` component is used to display a grid of assets owned by a specific user. The `where` prop is used to filter the assets by owner, and the `orderBy` prop is used to sort the assets by creation date in descending order. The `perPage` prop is set to 12, which means that each page will display 12 assets. The `cols` prop is set to 4, which means that each row will display 4 assets. The `showPageNumbers` prop is set to `false`, which means that the page numbers will not be displayed.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `AssetList` component?
- The `AssetList` component is used to display a list of assets with pagination and filtering options.

2. What external libraries are being used in this code?
- The code is using several external libraries including React, react-morphing-modal, next/link, lodash, @apollo/client, and ethers.

3. What is the purpose of the `useContract` and `useTokenTypes` hooks?
- It is unclear from this code what the `useContract` and `useTokenTypes` hooks are doing, as they are not used in this file. It is possible that they are custom hooks defined elsewhere in the project.
