The `AssetModal` component is a React component that renders a modal window displaying information about a specific asset. It imports several other components and libraries, including `useRouter` from the Next.js framework, `Modal` from the `react-morphing-modal` library, and several custom components related to bidding and asset ownership.

The `AssetModal` component takes in a `props` object, which includes a `modalProps` object that is passed to the `Modal` component. The `Modal` component is used to display the asset information in a modal window, and the `modalProps` object is used to configure the modal's appearance and behavior.

The `AssetModal` component also uses the `useAsset` hook to retrieve information about the asset being displayed. This hook takes in a `tokenId` parameter, which is obtained from the `router.query` object using the `useRouter` hook. The `useAsset` hook returns an object containing various properties related to the asset, such as its current ask price, highest bid, and content URI.

The `AssetModal` component also includes several other custom components related to bidding and asset ownership, such as `SetBid`, `SetAsk`, `BidList`, and `BidModal`. These components are conditionally rendered based on whether the current user is the owner of the asset or not, and whether certain sections of the modal are currently being displayed or not.

Overall, the `AssetModal` component is a key part of the larger project's user interface, allowing users to view detailed information about specific assets and interact with them through bidding and ownership-related actions. Here is an example of how the `AssetModal` component might be used in the larger project:

```jsx
import AssetModal from "./components/AssetModal";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Assets</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/assets/123">Asset 1</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/assets/456">Asset 2</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="/assets/789">Asset 3</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <AssetModal />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, the `AssetModal` component is rendered at the bottom of the page, and is used to display detailed information about a specific asset when the user clicks on a link to that asset. The `AssetModal` component is passed any necessary props, such as the `tokenId` of the asset to display, and handles the rest of the logic for displaying the modal window and related components.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useRouter` hook and how is it used in this code?
- The `useRouter` hook is used to access the Next.js router object and retrieve the `tokenId` parameter from the query string. It is used to set the `tokenId` state variable and open the modal for the corresponding asset.

2. What is the purpose of the `show` state variable and how is it used in this code?
- The `show` state variable is an object that keeps track of which sections of the modal should be displayed. It is used to conditionally render the `SetAsk`, `HowOffline`, `HowReservations`, and `SetBid` components based on user actions.

3. What is the purpose of the `onClickBid` function and how is it used in this code?
- The `onClickBid` function is used to set the `modalBid` state variable and toggle the `showBidModal` state variable, which controls whether the `BidModal` component is displayed. It is passed as a prop to the `Asset` component and the `BidList` component to handle bid selection.
