This file contains various type definitions used in the zoo project. The project appears to be related to a marketplace for buying and selling digital media, as evidenced by the types related to bids and asks for media items. 

The file imports several types from external libraries, including `Currency`, `BigintIsh`, and `Token` from `@zoolabs/zdk`, and `BigNumber` from `ethers`. These types are likely used throughout the project to represent various values related to cryptocurrency and blockchain transactions.

The file defines several custom types, including `TokenId`, `Ask`, and `Bid`. `TokenId` is simply a string or number used to identify a particular token. `Ask` and `Bid` are more complex types used to represent offers to buy or sell media items. Both types include an `amount` field, which can be either a `BigintIsh` or a `BigNumber`, representing the amount of cryptocurrency being offered. They also include a `currency` field, which is a string representing the type of cryptocurrency being used. `Bid` includes additional fields such as `bidder`, `recipient`, and `sellOnShare`, which are used to specify the details of the transaction.

The file also defines several types used in GraphQL responses, including `GraphUser`, `GraphCurrency`, `GraphMedia`, `GraphAsk`, `GraphBid`, and `GraphLazyBid`. These types are used to represent various pieces of information related to media items and transactions, such as the owner of a media item, the amount of a bid or ask, and the timestamp of when the transaction was created.

Finally, the file defines several additional types used in the project, including `CoingeckoPrices`, which is an object containing USD prices for various cryptocurrencies, and `HighestBid`, which is a custom type used to represent the highest bid for a particular media item.

Overall, this file provides a set of useful type definitions for various pieces of data used throughout the zoo project, particularly related to buying and selling digital media items. These types can be used to ensure consistency and type safety throughout the project, and to make it easier to work with data from external libraries and APIs.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Token` and `Currency` imports from `@zoolabs/zdk`?
- `Token` and `Currency` are likely used for handling token and currency-related functionality within the `zoo` project.

2. What is the difference between `Ask` and `Bid` types?
- `Ask` represents an ask order, which is an offer to sell a certain amount of a currency for another currency, while `Bid` represents a bid order, which is an offer to buy a certain amount of a currency with another currency.

3. What is the purpose of the `GraphLazyBid` type and why is the `media` property commented out?
- `GraphLazyBid` is likely used to represent a bid object without the associated media, which can be loaded lazily. The `media` property is commented out because it is not always necessary to load the media for a bid object, and doing so can be expensive.
