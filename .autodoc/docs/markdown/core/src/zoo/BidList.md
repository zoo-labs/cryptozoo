The code defines a React component called `BidList` that fetches and displays a list of bids from a GraphQL API. The component takes in several props, including `where`, `empty`, `showToken`, and `onClick`, which are used to filter the bids, display a message when there are no bids, show the token used for the bids, and handle click events respectively.

The component uses the `useQuery` hook from the `@apollo/client` library to fetch the bids from the GraphQL API. The GraphQL query is defined using the `gql` function and specifies the fields to be returned for each bid, including the bid amount, creation timestamp, currency, bidder, and media. The `where` prop is used to filter the bids based on the media and/or bidder ID. The `fetchPolicy` option is set to `'no-cache'` to ensure that the query is always sent to the server instead of being cached. The `pollInterval` option is set to `10000` to refetch the bids every 10 seconds.

The fetched bids are stored in the `data` object returned by the `useQuery` hook. If there are bids, the component maps over them and renders a `BidItem` component for each bid. The `getUsdAmount` function is passed to each `BidItem` component to convert the bid amount to USD. If there are no bids, the component either renders the `empty` prop or a default message.

The `BidList` component is exported as the default export of the module and can be imported and used in other parts of the project. For example, it could be used in a page that displays a list of bids for a particular media item or bidder. Here's an example of how the `BidList` component could be used:

```
import BidList from './BidList'

const MyBidsPage = () => {
  const myBidsFilter = { bidder: 'my-bidder-id' }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Bids</h1>
      <BidList where={myBidsFilter} empty={<div>No bids yet.</div>} showToken={true} />
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `usePrice` hook imported from `./state`?
- The `usePrice` hook is used to get the USD amount of a bid.

2. What is the purpose of the `pollInterval` option passed to `useQuery`?
- The `pollInterval` option specifies the time interval (in milliseconds) for refetching the query data.

3. What is the purpose of the `BidFilter` type and the `where` prop in `BidListProps`?
- The `BidFilter` type is used to define the filter options for the `where` prop, which is used to filter the bids returned by the GraphQL query.
