The `NetworkGuard` component in the `zoo` project is responsible for ensuring that the user is connected to a supported Ethereum network before allowing them to access certain features of the application. It imports several constants and modules from other parts of the project, including `DEFAULT_METAMASK_CHAIN_ID`, `NETWORK_ICON`, `NETWORK_LABEL`, and `SUPPORTED_NETWORKS` from the `networks` configuration file, as well as `ChainId` from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library. It also imports several React components, including `React`, `Fragment`, `useLingui`, `HeadlessUIModal`, `Image`, `NavLink`, `Typography`, and `useActiveWeb3React`.

The `NetworkGuard` component is defined as a higher-order function that takes an array of `ChainId` values as its argument and returns another function that takes a `children` prop. This returned function renders the `Component` function, which is defined as a functional component that takes a `NetworkGuardProps` object as its argument. This object has an optional `networks` property that defaults to an empty array. The `Component` function uses the `useLingui` hook to access the internationalization library, as well as the `useActiveWeb3React` hook to access the current Ethereum chain ID, library, and account.

The `Component` function renders a `HeadlessUIModal` component that is conditionally displayed based on whether the user is connected to a supported network. If the user is not connected to a supported network, the modal is displayed with a message indicating that the feature is not yet supported on the current network. The modal also provides a link to the home page and a list of available networks that the user can switch to. The list of available networks is generated dynamically based on the `networks` prop passed to the `Component` function.

Each network in the list is rendered as a button that, when clicked, sets a cookie with the selected chain ID and uses the `library` object to switch the user's Ethereum network to the selected network. If the selected network is a default network supported by MetaMask, the `wallet_switchEthereumChain` method is used to switch the network. Otherwise, the `wallet_addEthereumChain` method is used to add the network to the user's MetaMask network list.

The `NetworkGuard` component is exported as the default export of the module, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the `zoo` project. For example, it could be used to wrap components that require a specific Ethereum network to be connected, ensuring that the user is always on the correct network before accessing those components.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a React component called `NetworkGuard` that checks if the user's current network matches a list of supported networks, and displays a modal with options to switch networks if it doesn't. It also renders any child components passed to it.
   
2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
   
   This code relies on several external dependencies, including `@lingui/react`, `@zoolabs/zdk`, `cookie-cutter`, `next/image`, and `react`. It also imports several constants and functions from a `networks` configuration file.
   
3. What is the expected input and output of this code?
   
   The `NetworkGuard` function takes an array of `ChainId` values as input, and returns a higher-order function that takes child components as input and returns a React component that renders the `Component` function with the `networks` prop set to the input `ChainId` array. The `Component` function renders a modal and a list of network options, and renders any child components passed to it. The expected output is a React component that can be used to guard against unsupported networks and render child components.
