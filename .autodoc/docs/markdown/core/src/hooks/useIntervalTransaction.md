[View code on GitHub](zoo-labs/zoo/blob/master/core/src/hooks/useIntervalTransaction.ts)

The code defines a custom React hook called `useInterval` that allows for the execution of a given callback function at a specified interval. The hook takes in three parameters: `callback`, `delay`, and `leading`. 

The `callback` parameter is a function that will be executed at the specified interval. The `delay` parameter is the time in milliseconds between each execution of the `callback` function. If `delay` is set to `null`, the interval will not be set up. The `leading` parameter is a boolean that determines whether the `callback` function should be executed immediately upon setting up the interval or after the first interval has passed. 

The hook uses the `useRef` hook to create a reference to the `callback` function that is passed in. This reference is stored in the `savedCallback` variable. The `useEffect` hook is then used to update the `savedCallback` reference whenever the `callback` parameter changes. 

The `useEffect` hook is also used to set up the interval. The `tick` function is defined to execute the `savedCallback` function if it exists. If `delay` is not `null`, the `tick` function is called immediately if `leading` is set to `true`. The `setInterval` function is then called to set up the interval, and the `clearInterval` function is returned in a cleanup function to clear the interval when the component unmounts. 

The `useInterval` hook can be used in a larger project to execute a function at a specified interval. For example, it could be used to periodically fetch data from an API or to update the UI with new information. Here is an example of how the `useInterval` hook could be used to update the time displayed in a clock component every second:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import useInterval from './useInterval'

export default function Clock() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState(new Date())

  useInterval(() => {
    setTime(new Date())
  }, 1000)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{time.toLocaleTimeString()}</h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how is it used in the `zoo` project?
- This code defines a custom hook called `useInterval` that sets up an interval to repeatedly call a provided callback function. It is likely used throughout the `zoo` project to handle timed updates or animations.

2. What is the significance of the `useTransactionStatus` hook being imported and used in this code?
- The `useTransactionStatus` hook is likely used to determine whether or not the interval should be paused or stopped based on the current state of any ongoing transactions in the `zoo` project.

3. What is the purpose of the `leading` parameter in the `useInterval` function?
- The `leading` parameter determines whether or not the callback function should be called immediately upon setting up the interval, before any delay has passed. If `leading` is `false`, the first call to the callback will occur after the specified delay has passed.
