The code defines a custom React hook called `useSortableData` that can be used to sort an array of items based on a specified configuration. The hook takes two arguments: `items`, which is the array of items to be sorted, and `config`, which is an optional object that specifies the initial sorting configuration. 

The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the sorted items array, which means that the array will only be recalculated when either the `items` or `sortConfig` dependencies change. 

The `requestSort` function is used to update the sorting configuration based on the specified `key` and `direction`. If the `key` is already being used for sorting and the `direction` is currently ascending, the direction is changed to descending, and vice versa. 

The `getNested` function is a helper function that is used to retrieve nested properties from an object using a dot-separated path. For example, if the object is `{ a: { b: { c: 1 } } }` and the path is `'a.b.c'`, the function will return `1`. 

The sorting algorithm used by the hook is a standard comparison function that compares the values of the specified `key` property for each item in the array. If the values are `BigNumber` instances, they are compared using the `lt` and `gt` methods provided by the `@ethersproject/bignumber` library. If one of the values is `Infinity`, it is treated as the largest possible value. 

Overall, this hook provides a flexible and reusable way to sort arrays of items in a React application. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as sorting a table of data or a list of items. Here is an example of how the hook can be used to sort an array of objects by their `name` property:

```
import useSortableData from './useSortableData'

const items = [
  { name: 'Alice', age: 25 },
  { name: 'Bob', age: 30 },
  { name: 'Charlie', age: 20 },
]

function App() {
  const { items: sortedItems, requestSort, sortConfig } = useSortableData(items)

  return (
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th onClick={() => requestSort('name')}>
            Name {sortConfig && sortConfig.key === 'name' && sortConfig.direction === 'ascending' ? <>&#x25B2;</> : <>&#x25BC;</>}
          </th>
          <th onClick={() => requestSort('age')}>
            Age {sortConfig && sortConfig.key === 'age' && sortConfig.direction === 'ascending' ? <>&#x25B2;</> : <>&#x25BC;</>}
          </th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        {sortedItems.map(item => (
          <tr key={item.name}>
            <td>{item.name}</td>
            <td>{item.age}</td>
          </tr>
        ))}
      </tbody>
    </table>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a custom hook called `useSortableData` that can be used to sort an array of items based on a given configuration.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
   
   This code uses the `react` library as well as the `@ethersproject/bignumber` library to handle big numbers.

3. What is the role of the `getNested` function?
   
   The `getNested` function is used to retrieve a nested property from an object based on a given path. It replaces square brackets with a separator character and then splits the path into an array of property names, which are then used to traverse the object and retrieve the desired property.
