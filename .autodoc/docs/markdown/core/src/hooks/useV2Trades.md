The code in this file provides functions for finding the best trades for exchanging tokens in a decentralized exchange. The functions use the `@zoolabs/zdk` library to perform the trades. 

The `useAllCommonPairs` function takes two optional currency parameters and returns an array of valid pairs that can be used for trading. It uses the `useAllCurrencyCombinations` function to get all possible currency combinations and then filters out invalid and duplicated pairs. The resulting array of pairs is memoized to improve performance.

The `useV2TradeExactIn` function takes a `currencyAmountIn` parameter and a `currencyOut` parameter, and returns the best trade for exchanging the exact amount of `currencyAmountIn` to `currencyOut`. It uses the `useAllCommonPairs` function to get the valid pairs and then searches for the best trade using the `Trade.bestTradeExactIn` method from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library. The function can take an optional `maxHops` parameter to limit the number of hops in the trade. If `maxHops` is greater than 1, the function searches for the best trade with varying hops and returns the best one. The function returns `null` if there are no valid pairs or if the trade cannot be executed.

The `useV2TradeExactOut` function is similar to `useV2TradeExactIn`, but it takes a `currencyIn` parameter and a `currencyAmountOut` parameter instead. It returns the best trade for exchanging `currencyIn` to the exact amount of `currencyAmountOut`. It also takes an optional `maxHops` parameter to limit the number of hops in the trade.

Both `useV2TradeExactIn` and `useV2TradeExactOut` use the `isTradeBetter` function from the `../functions/trade` module to compare trades and find the best one. The `BETTER_TRADE_LESS_HOPS_THRESHOLD` constant from the `../constants` module is used as a threshold for determining if a trade is better than another. 

These functions can be used in a larger project that involves trading tokens in a decentralized exchange. They provide a convenient way to find the best trades for exchanging tokens and can be used to build more complex trading strategies. For example, a trading bot could use these functions to find the best trades and execute them automatically. 

Example usage:

```
import { useV2TradeExactIn } from './useV2Trades'

const currencyAmountIn = new CurrencyAmount(Currency.ETH, '1')
const currencyOut = Currency.USDC

const bestTrade = useV2TradeExactIn(currencyAmountIn, currencyOut)

console.log(bestTrade)
// Output: Trade<Currency, Currency, TradeType.EXACT_INPUT>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useAllCommonPairs` function?
- The `useAllCommonPairs` function returns an array of valid and non-duplicated pairs that can be used for trading between two currencies.

2. What is the significance of the `MAX_HOPS` constant?
- The `MAX_HOPS` constant is used to limit the number of hops (intermediate trades) that can be made in a trade. It is set to 3 by default.

3. What is the role of the `useMemo` hook in the `useV2TradeExactIn` and `useV2TradeExactOut` functions?
- The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize the result of the function and prevent unnecessary re-renders. It returns the best trade for the given input and output currencies, based on the allowed pairs and the maximum number of hops.
