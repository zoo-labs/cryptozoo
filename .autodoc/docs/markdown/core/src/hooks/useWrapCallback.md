The `useWrapCallback` function in the `zoo` project is responsible for returning a wrap callback given the selected input and output currency. It is a React hook that takes in three parameters: `inputCurrency`, `outputCurrency`, and `typedValue`. It returns an object with three properties: `wrapType`, `execute`, and `inputError`.

The `useWrapCallback` function imports several modules from the `zdk` and `wallet` directories. It also imports the `useMemo` hook from React, which is used to memoize the result of the function.

The `useWrapCallback` function first retrieves the `chainId` and `account` from the `useActiveWeb3React` hook. It then retrieves the `wethContract` and `balance` using the `useWETH9Contract` and `useCurrencyBalance` hooks, respectively. The `inputAmount` is calculated using the `tryParseAmount` function from the `parse` module.

The function then returns a memoized object based on the input and output currencies. If the `wethContract`, `chainId`, `inputCurrency`, or `outputCurrency` is undefined, or if the `chainId` is `ChainId.CELO`, the function returns an object with `wrapType` set to `WrapType.NOT_APPLICABLE`. If the input currency is native and the output currency is WETH, the function returns an object with `wrapType` set to `WrapType.WRAP`. If the input currency is WETH and the output currency is native, the function returns an object with `wrapType` set to `WrapType.UNWRAP`. Otherwise, the function returns an object with `wrapType` set to `WrapType.NOT_APPLICABLE`.

If `wrapType` is `WrapType.WRAP`, the `execute` property is set to an async function that wraps the input amount of native currency to WETH. If `wrapType` is `WrapType.UNWRAP`, the `execute` property is set to an async function that unwraps the input amount of WETH to native currency. If `wrapType` is `WrapType.NOT_APPLICABLE`, the `execute` property is undefined.

If there is insufficient balance to execute the wrap or unwrap, the `inputError` property is set to an error message. Otherwise, the `inputError` property is undefined.

This function is used in the larger project to provide a wrap callback for the selected input and output currencies. It is used in conjunction with other functions and components to enable users to wrap and unwrap their native currency to and from WETH. For example, it may be used in a form where users can enter the amount of native currency they want to wrap or unwrap, and then click a button to execute the transaction.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a function called `useWrapCallback` that returns an object with information about whether a wrap or unwrap operation can be executed based on the selected input and output currencies, as well as the user input value.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several functions and hooks from other files in the `zoo` project, as well as two constants from an external library called `@zoolabs/zdk`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `useWrapCallback` function?
- The `useWrapCallback` function takes in three optional parameters: `inputCurrency`, `outputCurrency`, and `typedValue`. It returns an object with three properties: `wrapType`, `execute`, and `inputError`. The `wrapType` property is an enum that indicates whether the operation is a wrap, unwrap, or not applicable. The `execute` property is a function that executes the wrap or unwrap operation, if possible. The `inputError` property is a string that describes any errors with the user input value.
