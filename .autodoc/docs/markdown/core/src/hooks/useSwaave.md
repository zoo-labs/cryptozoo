The `useSushiBar` function is a custom React hook that provides functionality related to the SushiBar contract in the larger project. It imports several other custom hooks and libraries, including `useActiveWeb3React`, `useTransactionAdder`, `useSushiContract`, and `useSushiBarContract`. 

The hook returns an object with four properties: `allowance`, `approve`, `enter`, and `leave`. 

`allowance` is a string that represents the amount of SUSHI tokens that the user has approved for the SushiBar contract to spend on their behalf. The `fetchAllowance` function is called on mount and every 10 seconds thereafter to update the `allowance` state. 

`approve` is an asynchronous function that approves the SushiBar contract to spend an unlimited amount of SUSHI tokens on the user's behalf. It returns a transaction object that is added to the transaction history using the `addTransaction` function from the `useTransactionAdder` hook. 

`enter` is an asynchronous function that allows the user to deposit a specified amount of SUSHI tokens into the SushiBar contract. It returns a transaction object that is added to the transaction history using the `addTransaction` function. 

`leave` is an asynchronous function that allows the user to withdraw a specified amount of SUSHI tokens from the SushiBar contract. It returns a transaction object that is added to the transaction history using the `addTransaction` function. 

Overall, this hook provides a convenient way for other components in the project to interact with the SushiBar contract and manage SUSHI token deposits and withdrawals. 

Example usage: 

```
import useSushiBar from './useSushiBar'

function MyComponent() {
  const { allowance, approve, enter, leave } = useSushiBar()

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current allowance: {allowance}</p>
      <button onClick={approve}>Approve SushiBar</button>
      <button onClick={() => enter('10')}>Deposit 10 SUSHI</button>
      <button onClick={() => leave('5')}>Withdraw 5 SUSHI</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a custom React hook called `useSushiBar` that provides functions for interacting with the SushiBar smart contract. It allows users to approve, enter, and leave the SushiBar, which is a staking contract for SUSHI tokens.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including the `react`, `@ethersproject/bignumber`, and `@ethersproject/constants` packages. It also imports several custom hooks from other files in the project, such as `useContract` and `useActiveWeb3React`.

3. What improvements could be made to this code?
- The code currently uses strings to represent token amounts, but it would be more precise to use `BigNumber` objects instead. The code includes comments indicating that this should be updated in the future. Additionally, the error handling could be improved to provide more informative error messages to users.
