The `useMeowshi` function is a custom React hook that provides functionality for interacting with the Meowshi contract. The Meowshi contract is a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens in exchange for a reward token called MEOW. The purpose of this hook is to provide a simple interface for users to interact with the Meowshi contract from within a React application.

The hook uses several other custom hooks to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, including `useActiveWeb3React`, `useTransactionAdder`, `useMeowshiContract`, `useSushiContract`, and `useSushiBarContract`. These hooks provide access to the user's Ethereum account, the Meowshi contract, and the SushiSwap contracts.

The `useMeowshi` hook provides several functions for interacting with the Meowshi contract, including `approve`, `meow`, `unmeow`, `meowSushi`, and `unmeowSushi`. These functions allow the user to approve the Meowshi contract to spend their tokens, deposit tokens into the contract, and withdraw tokens from the contract. The `meowSushi` and `unmeowSushi` functions are specific to the SushiSwap version of the Meowshi contract.

The hook also provides an `approvalState` variable that indicates whether the user has approved the Meowshi contract to spend their tokens. This variable is updated automatically when the user interacts with the contract.

Overall, the `useMeowshi` hook provides a simple and convenient way for users to interact with the Meowshi contract from within a React application. By abstracting away the complexity of interacting with the Ethereum blockchain, this hook makes it easier for developers to build applications that use the Meowshi contract. 

Example usage:

```
import useMeowshi from './useMeowshi'

function MyComponent() {
  const { approvalState, approve, meow, unmeow } = useMeowshi(false)

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Approval state: {approvalState}</p>
      <button onClick={approve}>Approve</button>
      <button onClick={() => meow({ value: '1000000000000000000' })}>Meow</button>
      <button onClick={() => unmeow({ value: '1000000000000000000' })}>Unmeow</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a custom hook called `useMeowshi` that provides functions for interacting with the Meowshi contract, allowing users to enter and leave the Meowshi pool and the Sushi pool. It also handles approval of the contract to spend the user's tokens.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code relies on several external dependencies, including `react`, `@ethersproject/bignumber`, and custom hooks defined in other files such as `useContract` and `useActiveWeb3React`.

3. What is the significance of the `pendingApproval` state variable?
- The `pendingApproval` state variable is used to track whether an approval transaction is currently pending. It is set to `true` when the user initiates an approval transaction and set back to `false` when the transaction is complete or fails. This is used to prevent the user from initiating multiple approval transactions simultaneously.
