The code in this file defines a function called `useTransactionDeadline` that is used to calculate the deadline for any submitted transaction in the larger project. The function imports the `BigNumber` class from the `@ethersproject/bignumber` library, the `useAppSelector` hook from the `../state/hooks` file, the `useCurrentBlockTimestamp` hook from the `./useCurrentBlockTimestamp` file, and the `useMemo` hook from the `react` library.

The `useTransactionDeadline` function first retrieves the user's deadline setting using the `useAppSelector` hook and stores it in a constant called `ttl`. It then calls the `useCurrentBlockTimestamp` hook to get the current block timestamp and stores it in a variable called `blockTimestamp`. The function then uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the result of the deadline calculation.

The deadline calculation is performed by adding the user's deadline setting (`ttl`) to the current block timestamp (`blockTimestamp`) using the `add` method of the `BigNumber` class. If either `blockTimestamp` or `ttl` is undefined, the function returns undefined.

This function can be used in the larger project to ensure that any submitted transaction has a deadline that is appropriate for the current block timestamp and the user's deadline setting. For example, the function could be called when a user submits a transaction to a smart contract to ensure that the transaction is only valid for a certain amount of time. 

Here is an example usage of the `useTransactionDeadline` function:

```
import useTransactionDeadline from './useTransactionDeadline'

function submitTransaction() {
  const deadline = useTransactionDeadline()
  // submit transaction with deadline
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `useTransactionDeadline` function?
- The purpose of the `useTransactionDeadline` function is to combine the block timestamp with the user setting to give the deadline that should be used for any submitted transaction.

2. What external libraries or modules are being imported in this code?
- The code is importing `BigNumber` from the `@ethersproject/bignumber` library, and `useAppSelector` from a custom module located in the `../state/hooks` file. It is also importing `useCurrentBlockTimestamp` and `useMemo` from the `react` library.

3. What values are being returned by the `useTransactionDeadline` function?
- The `useTransactionDeadline` function returns a `BigNumber` value or `undefined`, depending on whether both `blockTimestamp` and `ttl` are defined. It uses the `useMemo` hook to memoize the result of the calculation, which is the sum of `blockTimestamp` and `ttl`.
