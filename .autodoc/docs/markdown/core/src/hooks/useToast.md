The code defines a custom hook called `useToast` that provides a set of functions to display toast notifications in a React application. The hook uses the `useMemo` hook from React to memoize the functions and avoid unnecessary re-renders. It also uses the `useDispatch` hook from the `react-redux` library to dispatch actions to the Redux store.

The `useToast` hook returns an object with the following functions:

- `toastError`: displays a toast notification with a red background and an error icon. It takes a `title` parameter (required) and an optional `description` parameter.
- `toastInfo`: displays a toast notification with a blue background and an info icon. It takes a `title` parameter (required) and an optional `description` parameter.
- `toastWarning`: displays a toast notification with a yellow background and a warning icon. It takes a `title` parameter (required) and an optional `description` parameter.
- `push`: adds a new toast notification to the Redux store. It takes a `Toast` object as a parameter, which has the following properties:
  - `id`: a unique identifier for the toast (generated from the `title` parameter using the `kebabCase` function from the `lodash` library).
  - `type`: the type of the toast (one of `toastTypes.DANGER`, `toastTypes.INFO`, `toastTypes.SUCCESS`, or `toastTypes.WARNING`).
  - `title`: the title of the toast (required).
  - `description`: an optional description of the toast.
- `remove`: removes a toast notification from the Redux store. It takes an `id` parameter (the same as the `id` property of the `Toast` object).
- `clear`: removes all toast notifications from the Redux store.

This hook can be used in any React component to display toast notifications. For example:

```
import React from 'react'
import useToast from './useToast'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { toastError, toastInfo, toastWarning } = useToast()

  const handleClick = () => {
    toastError('Error', 'Something went wrong!')
    toastInfo('Info', 'Here is some information.')
    toastWarning('Warning', 'Be careful!')
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Show Toasts</button>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

When the button is clicked, three toast notifications will be displayed: one with a red background and an error icon, one with a blue background and an info icon, and one with a yellow background and a warning icon.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a custom hook called `useToast` that provides functions for displaying toast notifications using Redux.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code imports several modules from external libraries including `lodash`, `react`, and `react-redux`.

3. What types of toast notifications are available and how are they triggered?
- This code provides functions for displaying toast notifications with different types including `toastError`, `toastInfo`, and `toastWarning`. These functions take a title and optional description as arguments and dispatch an action to add the toast to the Redux store.
