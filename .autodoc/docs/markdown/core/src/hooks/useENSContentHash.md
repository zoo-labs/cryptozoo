The `useENSContentHash` function is used to look up the contenthash associated with an ENS name. ENS (Ethereum Name Service) is a decentralized naming system built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to register human-readable domain names and associate them with Ethereum addresses or other metadata. The contenthash is a piece of metadata that can be associated with an ENS name and is used to store IPFS content hashes or other data.

The function takes an optional `ensName` parameter, which is the ENS name to look up. If no `ensName` is provided, the function returns an object with a `loading` property set to `true` and a `contenthash` property set to `null`. If an `ensName` is provided, the function first calculates the namehash of the ENS name using the `namehash` function from the `@ethersproject/hash` library. If the namehash calculation fails, the function returns an object with a `loading` property set to `true` and a `contenthash` property set to `null`.

The function then uses the `useENSRegistrarContract` and `useSingleCallResult` hooks from the `useContract` and `multicall` modules, respectively, to retrieve the resolver contract address associated with the ENS name. The `useENSRegistrarContract` hook returns the ENS registrar contract, which is used to look up the resolver contract address associated with the ENS name. The `useSingleCallResult` hook is used to call the `resolver` function on the registrar contract with the namehash of the ENS name as an argument. The result of this call is the resolver contract address associated with the ENS name.

If the resolver contract address is zero (i.e., the ENS name is not registered), the function returns an object with a `loading` property set to `true` and a `contenthash` property set to `null`. Otherwise, the function uses the `useENSResolverContract` hook to retrieve the resolver contract associated with the resolver contract address. The `useENSResolverContract` hook returns the resolver contract, which is used to look up the contenthash associated with the ENS name. The `useSingleCallResult` hook is used to call the `contenthash` function on the resolver contract with the namehash of the ENS name as an argument. The result of this call is the contenthash associated with the ENS name.

The function returns an object with a `loading` property set to `true` if either the resolver address or contenthash is still loading, and a `contenthash` property set to the contenthash associated with the ENS name if it is available, or `null` otherwise.

This function can be used in the larger project to retrieve the contenthash associated with an ENS name, which can be used to retrieve IPFS content or other metadata associated with the name. For example, the contenthash could be used to retrieve a website hosted on IPFS associated with the ENS name. An example usage of this function is as follows:

```
import useENSContentHash from './useENSContentHash'

function MyComponent({ ensName }) {
  const { loading, contenthash } = useENSContentHash(ensName)

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }

  if (!contenthash) {
    return <div>No contenthash found for {ensName}</div>
  }

  // Use contenthash to retrieve IPFS content or other metadata
  return <div>Contenthash: {contenthash}</div>
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines a custom React hook called `useENSContentHash` that performs a lookup for an ENS name to find its contenthash.

2. What other custom hooks are being used in this code?
- This code imports and uses two other custom hooks called `useENSRegistrarContract` and `useENSResolverContract` from the `useContract` module, as well as `useSingleCallResult` from the `multicall/hooks` module.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `useENSContentHash` hook?
- The `useENSContentHash` hook expects an optional string parameter called `ensName` and returns an object with two properties: `loading` (a boolean indicating whether the hook is currently loading data) and `contenthash` (a string or null value representing the contenthash of the ENS name).
