This code exports a function called `chunkArray` from a module located in the `zoo` project. The purpose of the `chunkArray` function is to take an array and split it into smaller arrays of a specified size. This can be useful in situations where you need to process large amounts of data in smaller, more manageable chunks.

The `chunkArray` function takes two arguments: the array to be chunked and the size of each chunk. It then returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains the specified number of elements from the original array.

Here is an example of how the `chunkArray` function can be used:

```
import { chunkArray } from 'zoo';

const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const chunkSize = 3;

const chunkedArray = chunkArray(myArray, chunkSize);

console.log(chunkedArray);
// Output: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9], [10]]
```

In this example, we import the `chunkArray` function from the `zoo` project and use it to split an array of numbers into smaller arrays of size 3. The resulting `chunkedArray` variable contains an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains 3 elements from the original array (except for the last sub-array, which contains the remaining elements).

Overall, this code provides a useful utility function for working with arrays in the `zoo` project. By exporting it as a module, it can be easily used in other parts of the project where array manipulation is needed.
## Questions: 
 1. **What does the `chunkArray` function do?** 
    The code exports the `chunkArray` function from a file located at `./chunkArray`, so a smart developer might want to investigate that file to understand what the function does.

2. **What other functions or variables are exported from the `zoo` module?** 
    The code only exports the `chunkArray` function, so a smart developer might want to check other files in the `zoo` module to see if there are any other exports.

3. **Is the `chunkArray` function used anywhere else in the `zoo` module?** 
    The code only exports the `chunkArray` function, so a smart developer might want to search the `zoo` module for any other files that import and use the `chunkArray` function.
