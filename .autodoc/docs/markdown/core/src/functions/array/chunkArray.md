The code provided is a utility function that is used to chunk an array into smaller arrays. The purpose of this function is to evenly distribute items among the chunks while ensuring that each chunk does not exceed a specified gas limit. 

The function takes in an array of items and an optional gas limit parameter. If the gas limit parameter is not specified, the function uses a default value of 2,000,000. The function then iterates through each item in the array and calculates the gas required by each item. If the current chunk is empty or the current item would not push the chunk over the gas limit, the item is added to the current chunk and the cumulative gas is incremented. If the current item would push the chunk over the gas limit, the current chunk is pushed to the chunks array, and a new chunk is created with the current item. 

Once all items have been iterated through, the function checks if there are any remaining items in the current chunk and pushes it to the chunks array if there are. The function then returns the chunks array.

This function can be used in the larger project to split up large arrays into smaller chunks that can be processed more efficiently. For example, if the project is processing a large number of transactions, this function can be used to split the transactions into smaller chunks that can be processed in parallel. 

Example usage:

```
const transactions = [/* array of transactions */];
const chunks = chunkArray(transactions, 500_000); // split transactions into chunks of 500,000 or less
for (const chunk of chunks) {
  // process each chunk of transactions
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `chunkArray` function?
- The `chunkArray` function takes an array of items and evenly distributes them into smaller arrays called chunks, based on a gas limit. 

2. What is the significance of the `gasRequired` property in this code?
- The `gasRequired` property is used to calculate the gas required by each item in the `chunkArray` function. If an item doesn't specify a `gasRequired` value, it defaults to `DEFAULT_GAS_REQUIRED`.

3. Why is the `CONSERVATIVE_BLOCK_GAS_LIMIT` value hard-coded?
- The `CONSERVATIVE_BLOCK_GAS_LIMIT` value is hard-coded as a conservative estimate of the current block gas limit. This is likely done to ensure that the `chunkArray` function doesn't exceed the gas limit and cause errors or unexpected behavior.
