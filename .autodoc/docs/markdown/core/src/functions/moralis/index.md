This code exports two modules from the `helpers` and `mapping` files in the `zoo` project. The `queryEggs` and `queryAnimals` functions are exported from the `helpers` file, while the `mapEgg` and `mapAnimal` functions are exported from the `mapping` file. 

The `queryEggs` function likely queries a database or data source for information about eggs in the zoo, while `queryAnimals` likely does the same for information about animals. These functions may be used in other parts of the `zoo` project to retrieve data about eggs and animals for display or manipulation.

The `mapEgg` and `mapAnimal` functions likely take in data about eggs and animals, respectively, and map that data to a specific format or structure. These functions may be used in other parts of the `zoo` project to transform data about eggs and animals into a format that is easier to work with or display.

Overall, this code is important for the `zoo` project as it provides access to functions that retrieve and transform data about eggs and animals. By exporting these functions, other parts of the project can easily use them without having to duplicate code or write their own functions. 

Example usage of these exported functions:

```
import { queryEggs, mapEgg } from './zoo'

const eggs = queryEggs() // retrieves data about eggs
const mappedEggs = eggs.map(egg => mapEgg(egg)) // maps the retrieved data to a specific format
```
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `helpers` and `mapping` files?** 
    - The `helpers` file likely contains functions that assist with querying data related to eggs and animals, while the `mapping` file likely contains functions that transform the queried data into a desired format.
2. **What other files or modules does this code interact with?**
    - It is unclear from this code snippet alone what other files or modules this code may interact with. Further investigation into the project's file structure and dependencies would be necessary to determine this.
3. **What is the intended use case for the exported functions?**
    - Without additional context, it is unclear what the intended use case for the exported functions (`queryEggs`, `queryAnimals`, `mapEgg`, and `mapAnimal`) is. It is possible that they are used to retrieve and manipulate data related to a zoo's animal and egg populations, but this cannot be confirmed without more information.
