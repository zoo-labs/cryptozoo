This code defines two objects, `USD_CURRENCY` and `ETH_CURRENCY`, which contain information about the addresses and decimal places of various currencies on different blockchain networks. The `Currency` type is defined as an object with an `address` property (a string representing the currency's contract address) and a `decimals` property (an integer representing the number of decimal places the currency uses). 

The `USD_CURRENCY` object contains information for several different networks, including Ethereum mainnet, Ropsten, Kovan, Rinkeby, GÃ¶erli, Binance Smart Chain, Binance Smart Chain testnet, HECO, HECO testnet, Polygon, Polygon testnet, xDai, and Arbitrum. The `ETH_CURRENCY` object only contains information for Ethereum mainnet. 

The `getCurrency` function takes a `ChainId` argument (an enum defined in the `@zoolabs/zdk` package) and returns the corresponding `Currency` object from `USD_CURRENCY` if it exists, or a default `Currency` object with an `address` of `AddressZero` (a constant from the `@ethersproject/constants` package) and `decimals` of 18 if it does not. 

This code is likely used in the larger project to provide a centralized place to store information about the addresses and decimal places of various currencies on different networks. Other parts of the project can import these objects and use them to perform currency-related calculations or display currency information to users. For example, a user interface component might use the `getCurrency` function to display the appropriate currency symbol and decimal formatting for a given network. 

Example usage:
```
import { USD_CURRENCY, getCurrency, ChainId } from 'zoo'

console.log(USD_CURRENCY[ChainId.MAINNET]) // { address: '0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7', decimals: 6 }

console.log(getCurrency(ChainId.BSC_TESTNET)) // { address: '0x337610d27c682E347C9cD60BD4b3b107C9d34dDd', decimals: 18 }
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Currency` type and how is it used in this code?
- The `Currency` type defines an object with an `address` property (a string) and a `decimals` property (a number). It is used to represent different currencies on different blockchain networks.

2. What is the significance of the `USD_CURRENCY` and `ETH_CURRENCY` constants?
- `USD_CURRENCY` is an object that maps `ChainId` values to `Currency` objects representing the USD stablecoin on different blockchain networks. `ETH_CURRENCY` is a similar object representing Ether on different networks.

3. What is the purpose of the `getCurrency` function and how does it work?
- The `getCurrency` function takes a `ChainId` argument and returns the corresponding `Currency` object from `USD_CURRENCY` if it exists, or a default `Currency` object with an `address` of `AddressZero` and `decimals` of 18 if it does not. This function is used to retrieve the appropriate pricing currency for a given blockchain network.
