[View code on GitHub](zoo-labs/zoo/blob/master/core/src/functions/currency/currencyId.ts)

The code in this file defines a function called `currencyId` that takes a `Currency` object as an argument and returns a string representing the currency's ID. The `Currency` object is imported from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library, which is presumably part of the larger zoo project.

The `currencyId` function first checks if the `Currency` object's `chainId` property is equal to `ChainId.CELO`. If it is, the function returns the `address` property of the `wrapped` property of the `Currency` object. This suggests that the `Currency` object has a `wrapped` property that contains information about the wrapped version of the currency on the CELO blockchain.

If the `chainId` property is not equal to `ChainId.CELO`, the function checks if the `Currency` object's `isNative` property is true. If it is, the function returns the string `'ETH'`. This suggests that the `Currency` object represents the native currency of the Ethereum blockchain.

If the `isNative` property is false, the function checks if the `Currency` object's `isToken` property is true. If it is, the function returns the `address` property of the `Currency` object. This suggests that the `Currency` object represents a token on some blockchain.

If neither of the previous conditions are true, the function throws an error with the message `'invalid currency'`. This suggests that the `Currency` object is expected to have either a `wrapped` property or an `address` property, and that the function is designed to handle specific types of currencies.

It's possible that this function is used in other parts of the zoo project to convert `Currency` objects into IDs that can be used in other contexts, such as in smart contracts or API requests. Here's an example of how this function might be used:

```
import { Currency } from '@zoolabs/zdk'
import { currencyId } from 'zoo'

const currency = new Currency('CELO', '0x123abc', 1)
const currencyId = currencyId(currency) // returns '0x123abc'
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a function called `currencyId` that takes a `Currency` object as input and returns a string representing the currency's ID.

2. What is the `@zoolabs/zdk` package used for?
   The `@zoolabs/zdk` package is used to import the `ChainId` and `Currency` classes that are used in this code.

3. Why is there commented-out code at the bottom of the file?
   The commented-out code defines a different version of the `currencyId` function that takes an additional `chainId` parameter and uses different logic to determine the currency ID. It is possible that this code was an earlier version of the function that was replaced by the current implementation.
