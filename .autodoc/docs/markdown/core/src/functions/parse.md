The code in this file provides functions for parsing and converting currency amounts in the context of the larger zoo project. 

The first import statement brings in the necessary modules from the '@zoolabs/zdk' library, including Currency, CurrencyAmount, and JSBI. The second import statement brings in the parseUnits function from the '@ethersproject/units' library.

The parseBalance function takes a string value and an optional number of decimal places as arguments, and returns a parsed currency amount using the parseUnits function. If no value is provided, it defaults to '0'. This function could be used to convert user input into a standardized currency amount for use in other parts of the project.

The tryParseAmount function attempts to parse a user-entered amount for a given token. It takes a string value and a currency object as arguments, and returns a CurrencyAmount object if successful. If either argument is missing, it returns undefined. The function first attempts to parse the value using the parseUnits function and the decimal places specified in the currency object. If successful, it creates a new CurrencyAmount object using the parsed value and the currency object. If the parsed value is zero, it returns undefined. If an error occurs during parsing, it catches the error and returns undefined. This function could be used to validate and convert user input for specific tokens in the project.

Overall, these functions provide important functionality for handling currency amounts in the zoo project, allowing for standardized parsing and conversion of user input.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `parseBalance` function?
- The `parseBalance` function takes a string value and a decimal value (defaulting to 18 if not provided) and returns a parsed value in the specified decimal format using the `parseUnits` function from the `@ethersproject/units` library.

2. What is the purpose of the `tryParseAmount` function?
- The `tryParseAmount` function attempts to parse a user-entered amount for a given token by taking a string value and a currency object and returning a `CurrencyAmount` object if successful. It uses the `parseUnits` function to parse the value and the `CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount` function to create the `CurrencyAmount` object.

3. What is the purpose of the `JSBI` import?
- The `JSBI` import is used to create a `BigInt` value from the parsed value in the `tryParseAmount` function. This is necessary because the `CurrencyAmount.fromRawAmount` function requires a `BigInt` value as its second argument.
