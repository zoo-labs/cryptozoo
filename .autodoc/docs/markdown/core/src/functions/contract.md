This file contains several utility functions that are used throughout the zoo project. 

The `getSigner` function takes a `Web3Provider` instance and an Ethereum account address as arguments and returns a `JsonRpcSigner` instance that is connected to the specified account. This function is used to sign transactions on behalf of the specified account.

The `getProviderOrSigner` function takes a `Web3Provider` instance and an optional Ethereum account address as arguments and returns either the `Web3Provider` instance or a `JsonRpcSigner` instance that is connected to the specified account. If an account address is provided, the function returns a `JsonRpcSigner` instance that can be used to sign transactions. If no account address is provided, the function returns the `Web3Provider` instance, which can be used to read data from the blockchain.

The `getContract` function takes an Ethereum contract address, an ABI (Application Binary Interface) definition, a `Web3Provider` instance, and an optional Ethereum account address as arguments and returns a `Contract` instance that is connected to the specified contract address. This function is used to interact with smart contracts on the blockchain.

The `getRouterAddress` function takes an optional `ChainId` enum value as an argument and returns the address of the Uniswap router contract for the specified chain. If no chain ID is provided, the function throws an error.

The `getRouterContract` function takes a `ChainId` enum value, a `Web3Provider` instance, and an optional Ethereum account address as arguments and returns a `Contract` instance that is connected to the Uniswap router contract for the specified chain. This function is used to interact with the Uniswap router contract on the blockchain.

The `getArcherRouterContract` function takes a `ChainId` enum value, a `Web3Provider` instance, and an optional Ethereum account address as arguments and returns a `Contract` instance that is connected to the Archer Swap router contract for the specified chain. This function is used to interact with the Archer Swap router contract on the blockchain.

The `switchChain` function takes a `ChainId` enum value, a `Web3Provider` instance, and an Ethereum account address as arguments and switches the user's MetaMask wallet to the specified chain. This function is used to allow users to switch between different Ethereum networks in the zoo application.

Overall, these utility functions provide a convenient way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts in the zoo project. They are used throughout the project to sign transactions, read data from the blockchain, and interact with smart contracts.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- The purpose of this code file is to provide functions for interacting with smart contracts on different chains.

2. What are the parameters required for the `switchChain` function?
- The `switchChain` function requires `chainId`, `library`, and `account` parameters.

3. What is the difference between `getRouterContract` and `getArcherRouterContract` functions?
- `getRouterContract` function returns a contract instance for Uniswap V2 router on a specified chain, while `getArcherRouterContract` function returns a contract instance for Archer Swap router on a specified chain.
