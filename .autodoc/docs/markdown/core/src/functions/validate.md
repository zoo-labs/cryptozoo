This file contains several utility functions that are used throughout the zoo project. The functions are designed to perform various checks on input values and return a boolean or a string value based on the result of the check.

The first function, `isZero`, takes a string value as input and returns true if the value is zero in hex. This function is used to check if a given value is equal to zero in hex format.

The second function, `isEmptyObj`, takes an object as input and returns true if the object is empty. This function is used to check if a given object is empty or not.

The third function, `isEmptyValue`, takes a string value as input and returns true if the value is empty or zero. This function is used to check if a given value is empty or zero.

The fourth function, `isAddress`, takes a value as input and returns the checksummed address if the address is valid, otherwise returns false. This function is used to check if a given value is a valid Ethereum address.

The fifth function, `isTokenOnList`, takes a `TokenAddressMap` object and a `Token` object as input and returns true if the token is on the list. This function is used to check if a given token is on the list of supported tokens.

The sixth function, `isSameAddress`, takes two string values as input and returns true if the two addresses are the same. This function is used to check if two given addresses are the same.

Overall, these functions are used to perform various checks on input values throughout the zoo project. For example, `isAddress` is used to validate user input when adding a new token to the list of supported tokens, while `isTokenOnList` is used to check if a given token is supported by the project. These functions help ensure that the project is working with valid input values and can handle unexpected input values gracefully.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `isZero` function?
   - The `isZero` function returns `true` if the input string is zero in hex.
2. What is the purpose of the `isAddress` function?
   - The `isAddress` function returns the checksummed address if the input value is a valid address, otherwise it returns `false`.
3. What is the purpose of the `isTokenOnList` function?
   - The `isTokenOnList` function returns `true` if the input `token` is a valid token and exists in the `tokenAddressMap` for the corresponding chain ID.
