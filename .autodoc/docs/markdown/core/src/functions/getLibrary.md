This code is a TypeScript module that exports a single function called `getLibrary`. The purpose of this function is to create and return a `Web3Provider` object that is connected to a given Ethereum provider. The `Web3Provider` is a class from the `@ethersproject/providers` library that provides a way to interact with the Ethereum blockchain using the Web3 API.

The `getLibrary` function takes a single argument called `provider`, which can be any type of Ethereum provider. The function first creates a new `Web3Provider` object using the `provider` argument. If the `provider` object has a `chainId` property that is a number or a string that can be parsed as a number, then that value is used as the chain ID for the `Web3Provider`. Otherwise, the string `'any'` is used as the chain ID.

After creating the `Web3Provider` object, the function sets its `pollingInterval` property to 15 seconds. This property determines how often the `Web3Provider` will poll the Ethereum network for updates. 

The function then calls the `detectNetwork` method of the `Web3Provider` object to determine the current network that the provider is connected to. If the network has a known chain ID (i.e. it is one of the chain IDs defined in the `NETWORK_POLLING_INTERVALS` object), then the function sets the `pollingInterval` property of the `Web3Provider` to the corresponding value from the `NETWORK_POLLING_INTERVALS` object.

The `NETWORK_POLLING_INTERVALS` object is a constant object that maps Ethereum chain IDs to polling intervals in milliseconds. Currently, it only defines polling intervals for the Arbitrum and Harmony networks.

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to create a `Web3Provider` object that is connected to a given Ethereum provider and has a reasonable polling interval. It also allows for customization of the polling interval based on the current network, which can help improve performance and reduce unnecessary network traffic. 

Example usage:

```typescript
import { ethers } from 'ethers'
import getLibrary from './getLibrary'

// create an Ethereum provider using ethers.js
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your-project-id')

// create a Web3Provider object using the provider
const library = getLibrary(provider)

// use the library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain
const balance = await library.getBalance('0x123...')
```
## Questions: 
 1. What external libraries or dependencies are being used in this code?
- The code is importing `ExternalProvider`, `JsonRpcFetchFunc`, and `Web3Provider` from the `@ethersproject/providers` library, as well as `ChainId` from the `@zoolabs/zdk` library.

2. What is the purpose of the `NETWORK_POLLING_INTERVALS` object?
- The `NETWORK_POLLING_INTERVALS` object is used to store polling intervals for different chain IDs. The polling interval is set to a specific value if the chain ID matches one of the keys in the object.

3. What is the purpose of the `getLibrary` function and what does it return?
- The `getLibrary` function takes in a provider and returns a `Web3Provider` instance. It sets the polling interval of the instance to 15 seconds and also detects the network of the provider and sets the polling interval to a specific value if the network's chain ID matches one of the keys in the `NETWORK_POLLING_INTERVALS` object.
