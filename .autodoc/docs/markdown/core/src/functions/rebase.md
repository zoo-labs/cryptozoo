The code in this file provides two functions related to rebasing and converting values to an elastic value. The code imports the `BigNumber` class from the `@ethersproject/bignumber` library.

The `Rebase` interface defines an object with two properties: `base` and `elastic`, both of which are instances of the `BigNumber` class.

The `rebase` function takes three arguments: `value`, `from`, and `to`, all of which are instances of the `BigNumber` class. The function returns a `BigNumber` instance that represents the rebased value of `value` from `from` to `to`. If `from` is falsy, the function returns a `BigNumber` instance with a value of 0.

The `toElastic` function takes three arguments: `total`, `base`, and `roundUp`. `total` is an object that conforms to the `Rebase` interface, `base` is an instance of the `BigNumber` class, and `roundUp` is a boolean value. The function returns a `BigNumber` instance that represents the elastic value of `base` based on the `total` object. If `total.base` is equal to 0, the function returns `base`. Otherwise, the function calculates the elastic value of `base` using the formula `base * total.elastic / total.base`. If `roundUp` is true and the calculated elastic value is less than `base`, the function adds 1 to the elastic value.

These functions can be used in the larger project to perform rebasing and convert values to elastic values. For example, if the project involves a token with a changing supply, the `rebase` function can be used to adjust the value of a user's balance based on the new supply. The `toElastic` function can be used to convert a value to an elastic value that adjusts based on changes in the token's supply.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Rebase` interface?
   - The `Rebase` interface defines a type for an object with two properties: `base` and `elastic`, both of which are of type `BigNumber`.

2. What do the `rebase` and `toElastic` functions do?
   - The `rebase` function takes in a `value`, `from`, and `to` `BigNumber` and returns a new `BigNumber` that is the result of multiplying `value` by `to` and dividing by `from`. If `from` is falsy, the function returns `BigNumber.from(0)`.
   - The `toElastic` function takes in a `total` object of type `Rebase`, a `base` `BigNumber`, and a `roundUp` boolean. It calculates a new `BigNumber` called `elastic` based on the `total` object's `base` and `elastic` properties and the `base` argument. If `roundUp` is true and the calculated `elastic` value is less than `base`, it adds 1 to `elastic`. The function then returns `elastic`.

3. What external library is being used in this code?
   - The code is importing the `BigNumber` class from the `@ethersproject/bignumber` library.
