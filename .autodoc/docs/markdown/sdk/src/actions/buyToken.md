The `buyToken` function is used to instantly buy a token on the Ethereum blockchain. It takes in an object `data` that contains the following properties:

- `items`: An array of tokens to be purchased, which can also include an order ID or raw orders to execute.
- `expectedPrice`: The total price used to protect the buyer from price moves. This is passed as a number with the unit 'ether', for example, `1.543` means 1.543 ETH.
- `options`: Additional options to pass into the buy request.
- `signer`: An Ethereum signer object provided by the browser.
- `onProgress`: A callback function to update the UI state as execution progresses.

The function first extracts the necessary properties from the `data` object and then gets the taker's address from the signer. It then gets the client object using the `getClient` function and sets the `options` property to an empty object if it is not provided. The function then gets the base API URL from the client object and sets up an error handler function.

If the base API URL is not available, the function throws a `ReferenceError`. Otherwise, it constructs the `params` object with the `items`, `taker`, `source`, and `options` properties. If the client object has a `normalizeRoyalties` property and the `normalizeRoyalties` property is not already set in `params`, it sets it to the value of the client's `normalizeRoyalties` property.

The function then calls the `executeSteps` function with the `params` object, the signer object, the `onProgress` callback, `undefined`, and the `expectedPrice` value. If an error occurs, the error handler function is called, and the error is re-thrown.

Overall, this function is used to buy tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and can be used in a larger project that involves buying and selling tokens. Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
import { buyToken } from 'zoo'

const data = {
  items: [
    {
      token: '0x123...',
      amount: 1,
    },
  ],
  expectedPrice: 1.543,
  options: {
    gasPrice: 1000000000,
  },
  signer: signerObject,
  onProgress: (steps, path) => {
    // update UI state
  },
}

buyToken(data)
  .then((result) => {
    // handle success
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // handle error
  })
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `buyToken` function?
- The `buyToken` function is used to instantly buy a token, with options for specifying the tokens to be purchased, expected price, additional options, signer, and a callback for updating UI state as execution progresses.

2. What is the `Data` type and what does it contain?
- The `Data` type is an interface that contains properties for specifying the items to be purchased, expected price, additional options, signer, and a callback for updating UI state as execution progresses.

3. What is the purpose of the `errHandler` function and when is it called?
- The `errHandler` function is called when an error occurs during the execution of the `buyToken` function. It is used to refresh the tokens that were attempted to be purchased in the event of an error.
