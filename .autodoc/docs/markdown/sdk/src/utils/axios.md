This code imports the Axios library and an AxiosResponse type from the 'axios' module. It then sets up an interceptor on the Axios instance named '_axios'. The interceptor is used to intercept responses from the server before they are passed to the calling code. 

The interceptor checks if the 'Deprecation' header is set to 'true' in the response. If it is, a warning message is logged to the console indicating that the API being called is deprecated and may have stability and performance issues. The warning message includes the URL of the deprecated API.

Finally, the code exports the '_axios' instance as 'axios', making it available for use in other parts of the project.

This code is useful in a larger project that uses Axios to make API calls. By intercepting responses and checking for deprecated APIs, it helps ensure that the project is using up-to-date and stable APIs. It also provides a warning to developers if they are using a deprecated API, allowing them to take action to update their code.

Example usage:

```
import { axios } from 'zoo'

axios.get('/api/users')
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response.data)
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error)
  })
```

In this example, the 'axios' instance from the 'zoo' module is used to make a GET request to the '/api/users' endpoint. If the response includes a 'Deprecation' header set to 'true', a warning message will be logged to the console. Otherwise, the response data will be logged to the console. If an error occurs, it will be logged to the console as well.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the axios interceptor in this code?
   The axios interceptor is used to check if the API being called is deprecated and to log a warning message if it is.

2. What is the significance of the 'Deprecation' header in the response?
   The 'Deprecation' header is used to indicate whether the API being called is deprecated or not.

3. Why is the axios instance being exported as a separate variable?
   The axios instance is being exported as a separate variable to allow other modules to import and use it in their own code.
