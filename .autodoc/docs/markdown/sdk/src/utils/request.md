The code above is a function that exports a request method used to make HTTP requests. The purpose of this code is to provide a standardized way of making HTTP requests within the larger project. 

The function takes in an optional AxiosRequestConfig object as a parameter, which can be used to configure the request. The function first gets the current client using the `getClient()` function from another module. It then gets the current reservoir chain from the client using the `currentChain()` method. 

The function then sets the headers for the request. The headers include the `Content-Type` header set to `application/json` and a custom `x-rkc-version` header set to the version number from the `package.json` file. If the current reservoir chain has an `apiKey` property, the function adds an `x-api-key` header with the value of the `apiKey`.

Finally, the function returns a promise that makes the HTTP request using the `axios.request()` method. The `headers` object and any additional configuration options passed in through the `config` parameter are merged together using the spread operator (`...`) and passed as the configuration object for the `axios.request()` method.

This function can be used throughout the project to make HTTP requests in a consistent and standardized way. For example, if the project needs to make a GET request to an API endpoint, it can call the `request()` function like this:

```
request({
  method: 'get',
  url: 'https://example.com/api/data',
})
  .then(response => {
    // handle response
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // handle error
  })
```

This will make a GET request to `https://example.com/api/data` with the headers and any additional configuration options set by the `request()` function. The function returns a promise that can be used to handle the response or any errors that occur.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `getClient()` function and how is it implemented?
- The `getClient()` function is used to retrieve the current client for the zoo project. Its implementation is not shown in this code snippet.
2. What is the significance of the `x-rkc-version` header and where is its value coming from?
- The `x-rkc-version` header is used to indicate the version of the zoo project. Its value is retrieved from the `version` property in the `package.json` file.
3. What is the expected input for the `config` parameter in the `request()` function and how is it used?
- The `config` parameter is an optional object that can contain various Axios request configuration options. It is spread into the `axios.request()` call along with the `headers` object.
