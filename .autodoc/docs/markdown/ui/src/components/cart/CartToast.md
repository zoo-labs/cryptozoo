The `CartToast` component is a React functional component that renders a toast message with an icon and a message. The purpose of this component is to provide a reusable and customizable way to display feedback messages to the user. The component takes three props: `kind`, `message`, and `link`. 

The `kind` prop is optional and specifies the type of message to display. It can be one of three values: `'success'`, `'error'`, or `'warning'`. If no value is provided, the default value is `'success'`. Depending on the value of `kind`, the component will render a different icon and text color. 

The `message` prop is required and specifies the text message to display in the toast. 

The `link` prop is optional and can be used to provide a link or any other React node to display alongside the message. 

The component is built using the `Flex` and `Text` components from a custom library called `primitives`. The `FontAwesomeIcon` component is used to render the icons from the `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` package. 

Here is an example of how to use the `CartToast` component:

```
import CartToast from './CartToast'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CartToast message="Item added to cart" />
      <CartToast kind="error" message="Failed to add item to cart" />
      <CartToast kind="warning" message="Item already in cart" link={<a href="/cart">View cart</a>} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, three `CartToast` components are rendered with different `kind` and `message` props. The third toast also includes a link to the cart page. 

Overall, the `CartToast` component is a simple and flexible way to display feedback messages to the user in a consistent and customizable way.
