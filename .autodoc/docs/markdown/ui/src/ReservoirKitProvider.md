The `zoo` project contains a file that exports a React component called `ReservoirKitProvider`. This component is used to provide a context for the `ReservoirClientProvider` component and other components in the project. 

The `ReservoirKitProvider` component takes in several props, including `children`, `options`, `theme`, and `swrOptions`. The `children` prop is a required prop that represents the child components that will be wrapped by the `ReservoirKitProvider`. The `options` prop is an optional object that contains options for the `ReservoirClientProvider` component. The `theme` prop is an optional object that contains a theme for the `ReservoirKitProvider` component. The `swrOptions` prop is an optional object that contains options for the `SWRConfig` component.

The `ReservoirKitProvider` component creates a context for the `ReservoirClientProvider` component and other components in the project by using the `createContext` function from React. It also creates a context for the `ReservoirKitProviderOptions` object by using the `createContext` function.

The `ReservoirKitProvider` component sets default options for the `ReservoirClientProvider` component by creating an object called `defaultOptions`. This object contains an array of objects that represent different chains. Each chain object contains a `baseApiUrl`, an `id`, and an `active` property.

The `ReservoirKitProvider` component uses the `useEffect` hook to create a new theme and set it as the global theme. It also removes the old theme if there was one. The `useEffect` hook also sets the provider options.

The `ReservoirKitProvider` component returns a JSX element that wraps the child components with the `ThemeContext.Provider`, `TooltipPrimitive.Provider`, `ProviderOptionsContext.Provider`, `ReservoirClientProvider`, and `SWRConfig` components. The `ThemeContext.Provider` component provides the global theme to the child components. The `TooltipPrimitive.Provider` component provides a context for the tooltip component. The `ProviderOptionsContext.Provider` component provides the provider options to the child components. The `ReservoirClientProvider` component provides a context for the `ReservoirClient` component. The `SWRConfig` component provides options for the `swr` library.

Example usage:

```jsx
import { ReservoirKitProvider } from 'zoo'

function App() {
  return (
    <ReservoirKitProvider>
      <div>Child components go here</div>
    </ReservoirKitProvider>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code is a React component that exports a `ReservoirKitProvider` component. It provides a context for a ReservoirKit theme and options, as well as a `ReservoirClientProvider` component and an `SWRConfig` component for data fetching.

2. What are the dependencies of this code?
- This code imports several dependencies, including React, `createContext`, `FC`, `ReactNode`, `useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`, `ComponentPropsWithoutRef`, `useCallback`, `ReservoirClientOptions`, `ReservoirKitTheme`, `darkTheme`, `ReservoirClientProvider`, `SWRConfig`, `TooltipPrimitive`, `createTheme`, `ReservoirKitThemeContext`, `swrDefaultOptions`, `calendarCss`, and `useMutationObservable`.

3. What are the props accepted by the `ReservoirKitProvider` component?
- The `ReservoirKitProvider` component accepts three props: `children`, which is a required `ReactNode` representing the child components to be rendered; `options`, which is an optional object containing `ReservoirClientOptions` and `ReservoirKitProviderOptions`; and `theme`, which is an optional `ReservoirKitTheme`. It also accepts an optional `swrOptions` prop, which is an object of `ComponentPropsWithoutRef<typeof SWRConfig>['value']`.
