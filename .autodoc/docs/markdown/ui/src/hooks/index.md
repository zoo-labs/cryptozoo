This code exports a variety of custom React hooks from the `zoo` project. React hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic across components in a React application. 

The exported hooks can be divided into two categories: public and internal. Public hooks are intended to be used by other developers who are consuming the `zoo` project, while internal hooks are used within the `zoo` project itself.

The public hooks include `useCollections`, `useTokens`, `useListings`, and others. These hooks likely provide functionality related to interacting with collections, tokens, and listings within the `zoo` project. For example, `useCollections` may provide a way to fetch and manage collections of tokens within the project.

The internal hooks include `useCopyToClipboard`, `useMediaQuery`, `useTimeSince`, and others. These hooks are likely used within the `zoo` project to provide common functionality across components. For example, `useCopyToClipboard` may provide a way to copy text to the clipboard, which could be used in multiple components within the project.

Overall, this code provides a way for developers to reuse common stateful logic across components within the `zoo` project. By exporting these hooks, other developers can easily consume and integrate them into their own components. For example, a developer working on a new feature within the `zoo` project may use the `useCollections` hook to fetch and manage collections of tokens within their component.
