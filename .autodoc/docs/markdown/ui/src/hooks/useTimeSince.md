This code is a React component that calculates the time elapsed since a given timestamp and returns it as a string. It uses the `useEffect` and `useState` hooks from React to manage state and side effects.

The `dayjs` library is used to handle date and time calculations. Specifically, the `relativeTime` plugin is imported and extended to allow for the calculation of relative time (e.g. "2 hours ago").

The function takes an optional `timestamp` parameter, which is a Unix timestamp (i.e. the number of seconds since January 1, 1970). If a `timestamp` is provided, the `useEffect` hook is triggered and the `timeSince` state is updated with the relative time elapsed since the given timestamp. If no `timestamp` is provided, the `timeSince` state is set to an empty string.

The component can be used in a larger project to display the time elapsed since a certain event occurred. For example, it could be used in a social media app to show how long ago a post was made or in an e-commerce app to show how long ago an order was placed.

Here is an example of how this component could be used in a React component:

```
import React from 'react'
import TimeSince from './TimeSince'

function Post({ timestamp }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Posted {<TimeSince timestamp={timestamp} />} ago</p>
      <p>This is a post</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Post
```

In this example, the `TimeSince` component is used to display the time elapsed since the post was made. The `timestamp` prop is passed to the component to calculate the relative time.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
   This code exports a function that takes in a timestamp and returns a string representing the time since that timestamp in relative time (e.g. "2 hours ago").

2. What libraries are being used in this code?
   This code imports two libraries: `react` and `dayjs`. It also imports a specific plugin from `dayjs` called `relativeTime`.

3. What is the purpose of the `useEffect` hook in this code?
   The `useEffect` hook is used to update the `timeSince` state variable whenever the `timestamp` prop changes. If `timestamp` is not provided, `timeSince` is set to an empty string.
