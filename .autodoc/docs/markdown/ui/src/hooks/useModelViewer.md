This code defines a custom React hook called `useModelViewer` that enables the use of the Google Model Viewer library in a React application. The hook takes a boolean `enabled` parameter that determines whether or not to enable the Model Viewer functionality. 

The `useEffect` hook is used to manage the lifecycle of the Model Viewer library. When the `enabled` parameter is true and the `modelViewerInjected` flag is false, the `importScript` function is called to dynamically load the Model Viewer library from the specified URL. The `importScript` function creates a new `script` element and appends it to the `body` of the HTML document. 

The `importScript` function checks for the existence of the `document` object before creating the `script` element to avoid errors in non-browser environments. The `script` element is set to load asynchronously and its `type` attribute is set to `'module'` to indicate that it is an ES6 module. 

Once the Model Viewer library is loaded, the `modelViewerInjected` flag is set to true to prevent unnecessary re-loading of the library. The `useEffect` hook is dependent on the `enabled` parameter, so any changes to this parameter will trigger the hook to re-run and potentially load or unload the Model Viewer library. 

This hook can be used in a larger React project to enable the display of 3D models using the Google Model Viewer library. For example, a product catalog website could use this hook to display interactive 3D models of products to customers. 

Example usage:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react'
import useModelViewer from './useModelViewer'

const ProductDetail = ({ product }) => {
  const [modelViewerEnabled, setModelViewerEnabled] = useState(false)
  useModelViewer(modelViewerEnabled)

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{product.name}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setModelViewerEnabled(!modelViewerEnabled)}>
        {modelViewerEnabled ? 'Disable' : 'Enable'} 3D View
      </button>
      {modelViewerEnabled && (
        <model-viewer src={product.modelUrl} alt={product.name}></model-viewer>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `useModelViewer` hook is used to enable or disable the Model Viewer library based on the state of the `modelViewerEnabled` variable. When the user clicks the button, the `modelViewerEnabled` state is toggled and the Model Viewer library is either loaded or unloaded. If the library is enabled, a `model-viewer` element is rendered with the URL of the 3D model and alt text.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a custom React hook called `useModelViewer` that conditionally injects a script for the Google Model Viewer library into the document if the hook is enabled.

2. What is the significance of the `modelViewerInjected` variable?
   The `modelViewerInjected` variable is used to ensure that the script for the Google Model Viewer library is only injected once, even if the `useModelViewer` hook is called multiple times.

3. What is the `importScript` function doing?
   The `importScript` function creates a new `script` element with the specified `src` URL and appends it to the `body` of the document. The `type` attribute is set to `'module'` to indicate that the script is a JavaScript module.
