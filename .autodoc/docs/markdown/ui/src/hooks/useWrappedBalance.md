This code is a function that retrieves the balance of a specific token on the current blockchain network. The function imports a list of wrapped contract addresses from a separate file and uses the `useBalance` function from the `wagmi` library to retrieve the balance of the specified token. 

To use this function, the user must provide parameters to the `useBalance` function, which are passed to the function as an argument to this function. The function then calls the `useZooClient` function to retrieve the current blockchain network and uses it to determine the contract address of the specified token. If the current network is not in the list of wrapped contract addresses, the function defaults to the mainnet contract address. 

The function then calls the `useBalance` function with the specified parameters and the determined contract address. The function returns an object containing the balance of the specified token and the contract address used to retrieve the balance. 

Here is an example of how this function can be used:

```
import useTokenBalance from './useTokenBalance'

const params = {
  account: '0x1234567890abcdef',
  decimals: 18,
}

const tokenBalance = useTokenBalance(params)

console.log(tokenBalance.balance) // prints the balance of the specified token
console.log(tokenBalance.contractAddress) // prints the contract address used to retrieve the balance
```

Overall, this function is a useful tool for retrieving the balance of a specific token on the current blockchain network. It can be used in conjunction with other functions in the `zoo` project to provide users with information about their token holdings.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `wrappedContracts` constant imported from `../constants/wrappedContracts`?
- `wrappedContracts` is likely a mapping of chain IDs to contract addresses for wrapped tokens, used to determine the contract address based on the current chain.

2. What is the `useBalance` function being imported from `wagmi`, and what are the possible parameters that can be passed to it?
- `useBalance` is likely a function provided by the `wagmi` library for retrieving the balance of a given token. The possible parameters that can be passed to it are not clear from this code snippet.

3. What is the expected return value of this function?
- This function is expected to return an object with two properties: `balance`, which is the balance of the specified token, and `contractAddress`, which is the contract address of the specified token on the current chain.
