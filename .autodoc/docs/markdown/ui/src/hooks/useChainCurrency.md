The code is a utility function that is used to retrieve the native currency of a given blockchain network. The function takes an optional parameter `chainId` which is the unique identifier of the blockchain network. If the `chainId` is not provided, the function retrieves the current chain from the `reservoir-sdk` library. 

The function then searches for the chain with the given `chainId` in the list of chains provided by the `useNetwork()` hook from the `wagmi` library. If the chain is not found, the function returns the native currency of the first chain in the list. 

If the chain is found, the function checks if the chain is an Ethereum chain by checking if the chain id is in the list of Ethereum chain ids. If the chain is an Ethereum chain or if the chain does not have a native currency, the function returns the default Ethereum currency object with the name 'Ethereum', symbol 'ETH', and 18 decimals. If the chain is not an Ethereum chain and has a native currency, the function returns the native currency object of the chain.

This function can be used in a larger project to retrieve the native currency of a given blockchain network. For example, if a user wants to display the native currency of a selected blockchain network in a user interface, this function can be used to retrieve the currency information and display it to the user. 

Example usage:

```
import getChainCurrency from 'zoo'

const chainId = 1 // Example chain id
const currency = getChainCurrency(chainId)

console.log(currency) // { name: 'Ethereum', symbol: 'ETH', decimals: 18, address: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000', chainId: 1 }
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code exports a function `getChainCurrency` that returns the native currency of a specified or current chain, and a default function that calls `getChainCurrency` with the current network's chains.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code imports `@reservoir0x/reservoir-sdk`, `ethers`, and `wagmi`.

3. What is the expected input and output of the `getChainCurrency` function?
- The `getChainCurrency` function expects an array of `Chain` objects and an optional `chainId` number as input, and returns an object with properties `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, `address`, and `chainId`. If the specified chain is not found or does not have a native currency, it returns the default Ethereum currency object.
