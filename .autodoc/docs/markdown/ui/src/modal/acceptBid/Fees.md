The `Fees` component is a React functional component that takes in two props: `fees` and `marketplace`. The `fees` prop is an object that contains an optional array of `feeBreakdown` objects. Each `feeBreakdown` object contains three optional properties: `kind`, `recipient`, and `bps`. The `marketplace` prop is a string that represents the name of the marketplace.

The purpose of this component is to display a breakdown of fees associated with a transaction. If there are no fees, the component returns `null`. Otherwise, it maps over the `feeBreakdown` array and creates a new array of objects that contain the fee name, percentage, and tooltip message. The percentage is calculated by multiplying the `bps` (basis points) by 0.01. The `name` and `tooltipMessage` properties are determined based on the `kind` property of each `feeBreakdown` object. If the `kind` is "royalty", the name is "Creator Royalties" and the tooltip message is "A fee on every order that goes to the collection creator." If the `kind` is "marketplace", the name is set to `${marketplace} Fee` and the tooltip message is "A fee included in the order from the marketplace in which it was created." If the `kind` is anything else, the name is "Misc. Fees".

The component then returns a `Flex` container that displays the fee breakdown. The container includes a `Text` component that displays "Fees" as a subtitle, followed by a list of fees. Each fee is displayed as a `Flex` container with the fee name and percentage displayed side-by-side. If a tooltip message is available, an `InfoTooltip` component is displayed next to the fee name.

This component can be used in a larger project to display a breakdown of fees associated with a transaction. It can be customized to display different fee names and tooltip messages based on the `kind` property of each `feeBreakdown` object. The `marketplace` prop can be used to display the name of the marketplace where the transaction took place. An example usage of this component is as follows:

```
<Fees
  fees={{
    feeBreakdown: [
      {
        kind: 'royalty',
        recipient: 'creator',
        bps: 100,
      },
      {
        kind: 'marketplace',
        recipient: 'marketplace',
        bps: 50,
      },
    ],
  }}
  marketplace="OpenSea"
/>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Fees` component?
    
    The `Fees` component is used to display a breakdown of fees associated with a marketplace transaction.

2. What is the `Props` type and what properties does it contain?
    
    The `Props` type is an interface that defines the expected shape of the `props` object passed to the `Fees` component. It contains two properties: `fees` and `marketplace`. `fees` is an object that may contain an array of `feeBreakdown` objects, each of which has a `kind`, `recipient`, and `bps` property. `marketplace` is a string that represents the name of the marketplace associated with the transaction.

3. What is the purpose of the `parsedFeeBreakdown` variable?
    
    The `parsedFeeBreakdown` variable is an array of objects that represent a parsed version of the `feeBreakdown` array passed to the `Fees` component. Each object in the array has a `name`, `percentage`, and `tooltipMessage` property that is used to display the fee information in the UI. The `name` property is a string that represents the name of the fee, the `percentage` property is a number that represents the percentage of the fee, and the `tooltipMessage` property is a string that provides additional information about the fee.
