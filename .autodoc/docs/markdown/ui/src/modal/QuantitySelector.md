The `QuantitySelector` component is a reusable React component that provides a user interface for selecting a quantity within a given range. It takes in several props, including `max`, `min`, `quantity`, and `setQuantity`, which are used to determine the range of valid quantities and to update the selected quantity. 

The component is composed of three main elements: two buttons for incrementing and decrementing the quantity, and an input field for displaying and editing the current quantity. The buttons are styled using the `QuantityButton` component, which is a styled version of the `Button` component from the `../primitives` directory. The input field is styled using the `QuantityInput` component, which is a styled version of the `input` HTML element.

The `QuantitySelector` component uses the `PseudoInput` component to group the buttons and input field together and apply additional styling. The `PseudoInput` component is a custom component that wraps the `div` HTML element and applies some additional styles to make it look like an input field.

When the user clicks on the increment or decrement buttons, the `setQuantity` function is called with the new quantity value. The `onChange` and `onBlur` event handlers on the input field are used to update the quantity when the user types in a new value or leaves the input field. If the user enters an invalid value, such as a value outside of the valid range or a non-numeric value, the quantity is not updated.

Overall, the `QuantitySelector` component provides a simple and reusable way to allow users to select a quantity within a given range. It can be used in a variety of contexts, such as in an e-commerce application for selecting the quantity of a product to purchase. 

Example usage:

```
import QuantitySelector from './QuantitySelector'

function ProductPage() {
  const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(1)

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Product Name</h1>
      <p>Price: $10.00</p>
      <QuantitySelector
        min={1}
        max={10}
        quantity={quantity}
        setQuantity={setQuantity}
      />
      <button>Add to Cart</button>
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code exports a React component called `QuantitySelector` that renders a quantity selector UI element with buttons to increment and decrement the quantity and an input field to display and edit the quantity.

2. What are the required props for the `QuantitySelector` component?
- The `QuantitySelector` component requires four props: `max` (number), `min` (number), `quantity` (number), and `setQuantity` (function that takes a number as argument and returns void). It also accepts an optional `css` prop for custom styling.

3. What external libraries or components are used in this code?
- This code imports several components and libraries: `React` and `CSSProperties` from the `react` package, `Button` from a custom `../primitives` module, `PseudoInput` from another custom `../primitives/PseudoInput` module, `styled` from a custom `../../stitches.config` module, and `FontAwesomeIcon`, `faMinus`, and `faPlus` from the `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome` and `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons` packages.
