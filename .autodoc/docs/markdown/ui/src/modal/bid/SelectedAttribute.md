The code defines a React functional component called `SelectedAttribute` that renders a Flex container with two Text components inside it. The component takes two optional props, `attributeKey` and `attributeValue`, which are strings representing a key-value pair. If either of these props is not provided, the component returns null and does not render anything.

The Flex container has several CSS styles applied to it, including padding, borderRadius, backgroundColor, marginBottom, overflow, gap, and justifyContent. These styles give the container a rounded rectangular shape with a background color, some spacing between its child elements, and a maximum width of 100% (or fit-content on larger screens).

The first Text component inside the Flex container displays the `attributeKey` prop in a subtitle2 style with an accent color. If the screen width is less than or equal to 520 pixels (i.e., on a mobile device), the component does not display a colon after the `attributeKey`. Otherwise, it displays a colon.

The second Text component inside the Flex container displays the `attributeValue` prop in a subtitle2 style with a maximum width of 200 pixels and an ellipsis overflow. This means that if the `attributeValue` is longer than 200 pixels, it will be truncated with an ellipsis.

Overall, this component is likely used to display key-value pairs in a visually appealing and responsive way. It could be used in various parts of a larger React application, such as a product details page or a search results page. Here is an example of how the component might be used:

```
<SelectedAttribute attributeKey="Color" attributeValue="Blue" />
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SelectedAttribute` component?
   
   The `SelectedAttribute` component is used to render a selected attribute with a key-value pair in a styled `Flex` container with `Text` components.

2. What are the optional props that can be passed to the `SelectedAttribute` component?
   
   The optional props that can be passed to the `SelectedAttribute` component are `attributeKey` and `attributeValue`, both of which are strings.

3. What is the purpose of the `useMediaQuery` hook imported from `../../hooks`?
   
   The `useMediaQuery` hook is used to determine if the screen width is less than or equal to 520 pixels, which is stored in the `isMobile` variable and used to conditionally render the `Text` component in the `SelectedAttribute` component.
