The `TokenCheckout` component in the `zoo` project is responsible for rendering a checkout summary for a list of items in a shopping cart. It takes in several props including the number of items in the cart, an array of images for the items, the total price of the items in cryptocurrency, the equivalent USD price, the currency type, the blockchain network, and the size of the component. 

The component uses the `Flex` and `Text` components from the `primitives` module to create a layout that displays the item images and the item count on the left side of the component, and the total price and USD equivalent on the right side. The `FormatCryptoCurrency` component is used to format the cryptocurrency price with the appropriate currency symbol and decimal places, and the `FormatCurrency` component is used to display the USD equivalent price. 

The `Img` component is used to display the item images in a horizontal row, with the first image aligned to the left and the subsequent images overlapping it slightly. The `size` prop is used to determine the size of the images and the font size of the text in the component. 

Overall, the `TokenCheckout` component is a reusable component that can be used in various parts of the `zoo` project to display a summary of items in a shopping cart. It provides a clean and organized layout that is easy to read and understand. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import { TokenCheckout } from 'zoo'

const items = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'Lion',
    price: {
      amount: 0.5,
      currency: {
        symbol: 'ZOO',
        contract: '0x1234567890abcdef',
        decimals: 18,
      },
    },
    image: 'lion.jpg',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'Elephant',
    price: {
      amount: 1.2,
      currency: {
        symbol: 'ZOO',
        contract: '0x1234567890abcdef',
        decimals: 18,
      },
    },
    image: 'elephant.jpg',
  },
]

const totalPrice = items.reduce((acc, item) => acc + item.price.amount, 0)

const usdPrice = 0.05 // arbitrary USD price for 1 ZOO

const currency = items[0].price.currency

const chain = {
  id: 1,
  name: 'Ethereum',
}

const CheckoutSummary = () => (
  <TokenCheckout
    itemCount={items.length}
    images={items.map((item) => item.image)}
    totalPrice={totalPrice}
    usdPrice={usdPrice}
    currency={currency}
    chain={chain}
    size="LG"
  />
)
```
