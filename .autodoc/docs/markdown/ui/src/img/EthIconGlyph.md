This code exports a React component that renders an SVG image. The SVG image consists of two polygons, one on top of the other, forming a shape that resembles a house. The polygons are defined using the `path` element, which takes a `d` attribute that specifies the shape of the polygon using a series of commands. The `fill` attribute is set to black, which fills the shape with black color.

The component takes no props and returns the SVG image. It sets the width to "auto" and the height to "100%", which means the image will scale to fit its container. The `viewBox` attribute defines the position and size of the viewport, which is the visible area of the SVG image. In this case, the viewport starts at x=5, y=0 and has a width of 15 and a height of 24.

This component can be used in a larger project as a decorative element, such as a logo or an icon. It can be imported and rendered like any other React component. For example:

```
import React from 'react';
import HouseIcon from './HouseIcon';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my house</h1>
      <HouseIcon />
    </div>
  );
};
```

This code imports the `HouseIcon` component from the file where it is defined and renders it inside a `div` element. The resulting output will be a heading followed by the SVG image of the house.
