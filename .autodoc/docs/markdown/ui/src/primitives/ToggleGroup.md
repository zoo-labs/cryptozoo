This code defines a React component called `ToggleGroup` that renders a group of toggle buttons. It uses the `@radix-ui/react-toggle-group` library to implement the toggle group functionality. 

The `ToggleGroup` component takes in a `children` prop, which should be an array of `ToggleGroupButton` components. The `ToggleGroupButton` component is also defined in this file and is a styled version of the `ToggleGroupPrimitive.Item` component from the `@radix-ui/react-toggle-group` library. 

The `StyledToggleGroup` component is a styled version of the `ToggleGroupPrimitive.Root` component from the `@radix-ui/react-toggle-group` library. It sets some default styles for the toggle group container, such as padding, background color, and border radius. 

The `ToggleGroupButton` component sets some default styles for the toggle buttons, such as background color, text color, padding, and border radius. It also sets some styles for when the button is in a certain state, such as when it is hovered over or when it is toggled on. 

Overall, this code provides a reusable toggle group component that can be used in other parts of the project. Developers can import the `ToggleGroup` and `ToggleGroupButton` components from this file and use them in their own React components. For example, a developer could use the `ToggleGroup` component to render a group of filters that a user can toggle on and off. 

Example usage:

```
import { ToggleGroup, ToggleGroupButton } from './ToggleGroup'

function FilterGroup() {
  return (
    <ToggleGroup>
      <ToggleGroupButton>Filter 1</ToggleGroupButton>
      <ToggleGroupButton>Filter 2</ToggleGroupButton>
      <ToggleGroupButton>Filter 3</ToggleGroupButton>
    </ToggleGroup>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and where is it used in the zoo project?
   - This code defines a styled toggle group component and its button items using the Radix UI library. It is likely used in the zoo project to provide a UI element for toggling between different options or states.
2. What are the props that can be passed to the `ToggleGroup` component?
   - The `ToggleGroup` component accepts all props that can be passed to the `StyledToggleGroup` component, which includes any valid HTML attributes for a `div` element. Additionally, it requires a `children` prop of type `React.ReactNode`.
3. What is the purpose of the `$$focusColor` variable in the `ToggleGroupButton` styles?
   - The `$$focusColor` variable is a CSS custom property that defines the color used for the button's focus state. It is used in the `:focus` pseudo-class to apply a box shadow with the specified color when the button is focused.
