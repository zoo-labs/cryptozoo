This code exports a series of components from the `zoo` project. These components are used to create a user interface for the larger project. 

Each export statement is followed by the name of the component and the file path where it can be found. The components include `Anchor`, `Box`, `Button`, `Flex`, `EthLogo`, `FormatWrappedCurrency`, `FormatCurrency`, `FormatCryptoCurrency`, `Input`, `Text`, `Grid`, `Loader`, `Switch`, `Select`, `Slider`, `Popover`, `ToggleGroup`, `ToggleGroupButton`, `DateInput`, `ErrorWell`, `CryptoCurrencyIcon`, `Tooltip`, and `Img`. 

These components can be imported into other files within the `zoo` project or in other projects that use the `zoo` library. For example, if a developer wants to use the `Button` component in a file, they can import it like this:

```
import { Button } from 'zoo';
```

Then they can use the `Button` component in their code like this:

```
<Button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</Button>
```

Overall, this code serves as a way to organize and export the various components used in the `zoo` project. By exporting them in this way, other developers can easily use these components in their own code without having to manually copy and paste the code for each component.
