The `Tooltip` component is a custom tooltip implementation built on top of the `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` and `@radix-ui/react-popover` libraries. It provides a tooltip that can be used on both small and large devices. 

The component takes in several props, including `children`, `content`, `open`, `defaultOpen`, `onOpenChange`, and `delayDuration`. The `children` prop is the element that the tooltip will be attached to, while the `content` prop is the content that will be displayed in the tooltip. The `open` prop determines whether the tooltip is currently open or not, while the `defaultOpen` prop determines whether the tooltip should be open by default. The `onOpenChange` prop is a callback function that is called when the tooltip's open state changes. The `delayDuration` prop determines how long the tooltip should wait before opening.

The `Tooltip` component uses the `useMediaQuery` hook from the `@react-hookz/web` library to determine whether the device is small or not. If the device is small, the component renders a `Popover` component from the `@radix-ui/react-popover` library. Otherwise, it renders a `TooltipPrimitive` component from the `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` library. 

Both the `Popover` and `TooltipPrimitive` components have a `Trigger` component that wraps the `children` prop and a `Content` component that wraps the `content` prop. The `Content` component has an arrow that points to the `Trigger` component. The `Popover` component also has a `Root` component that wraps both the `Trigger` and `Content` components, while the `TooltipPrimitive` component has a `Root` component that wraps only the `Trigger` component.

The `Tooltip` component also has two styled components, `TooltipArrow` and `PopoverArrow`, which are used to style the arrows in the `TooltipPrimitive` and `Popover` components, respectively. 

Overall, the `Tooltip` component provides a flexible and customizable tooltip that can be used in a variety of contexts within the larger project. Here is an example of how the `Tooltip` component can be used:

```
import Tooltip from './Tooltip'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Tooltip content="Hello, world!">
        <button>Hover me!</button>
      </Tooltip>
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code exports a custom Tooltip component that uses the `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` and `@radix-ui/react-popover` libraries to display tooltips and popovers. It also uses the `@react-hookz/web` library to determine if the device is a small screen.

2. What are the props that can be passed to the Tooltip component?
- The Tooltip component accepts the following props: `children`, `content`, `open`, `defaultOpen`, `onOpenChange`, and `delayDuration`. It also accepts any additional props that can be passed to the `Popover.Content` or `TooltipPrimitive.Content` components.

3. What is the difference between the Tooltip and Popover components?
- The Tooltip component is used for small devices and displays a tooltip when the user hovers over the trigger element. The Popover component is used for larger devices and displays a popover when the user clicks on the trigger element.
