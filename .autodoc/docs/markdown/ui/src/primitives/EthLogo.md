This code defines a React component called `EthLogo` that renders one of three different Ethereum icons based on the current theme of the application. The component imports the `useContext` hook from React and two different context objects from other files in the project. 

The `ThemeContext` object is imported from a file called `ReservoirKitProvider` and is used to access the current theme of the application. The `ReservoirKitThemeContext` object is imported from a file called `stitches.config` and is used to access the different assets available in the current theme.

The `EthLogo` component first uses the `useContext` hook to get the current theme from the `ThemeContext`. It then checks the `ethIcon` property of the current theme to determine which Ethereum icon to render. If the `ethIcon` property is set to `'glyph'`, the component renders the `EthIconGlyph` component. If it is set to `'gray'`, the component renders the `EthIconGray` component. If it is set to `'purple'`, the component renders the `EthIconPurple` component.

This component can be used in other parts of the application to display the Ethereum logo in a consistent way based on the current theme. For example, it could be used in a header component to display the Ethereum logo next to the application name. 

Here is an example of how the `EthLogo` component could be used in another component:

```
import React from 'react'
import EthLogo from './EthLogo'

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <div className="header">
      <EthLogo />
      <h1>My Ethereum App</h1>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Header
```

In this example, the `EthLogo` component is used to display the Ethereum logo next to the application name in the header of the page.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a React component called `EthLogo` that displays one of three different Ethereum icons based on the current theme.

2. What is the `ThemeContext` and where does it come from?
   The `ThemeContext` is imported from a file called `ReservoirKitProvider` located in the parent directory. It is used to access the current theme of the application.

3. What is the `ReservoirKitThemeContext` and how is it used?
   The `ReservoirKitThemeContext` is imported from a file called `stitches.config` located in the parent directory. It is used to define the type of the `ethIcon` property in the theme object, which is then used to determine which Ethereum icon to display in the `EthLogo` component.
