This code defines a set of CSS properties for a flexible container element using the Stitches library. The `flexCss` object contains properties for `display`, `boxSizing`, `borderStyle`, and `borderWidth`, as well as several variants for `align`, `justify`, `direction`, and `wrap`. These variants allow for different alignment, justification, direction, and wrapping options for the flexible container element.

The `styled` function from the Stitches library is used to create two styled components: a default `div` element and an `AnimatedFlex` component that uses the `motion` library from Framer Motion. Both components use the `flexCss` object to define their CSS properties.

This code can be used in the larger project to create flexible container elements with different alignment, justification, direction, and wrapping options. For example, the `AnimatedFlex` component can be used to create animated flexible container elements with the same set of options. Here is an example of how the `AnimatedFlex` component can be used:

```
import { AnimatedFlex } from 'zoo'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <AnimatedFlex
      align="center"
      justify="between"
      direction="row"
      wrap="wrap"
    >
      {/* child elements */}
    </AnimatedFlex>
  )
}
```

This creates an animated flexible container element with centered alignment, space between justification, horizontal direction, and wrapping enabled. The child elements can be added inside the `AnimatedFlex` component and will be laid out according to the specified options.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `framer-motion` library being imported?
- The `framer-motion` library is being imported to allow for animation of the `div` element.

2. What is the purpose of the `styled` function being imported from `stitches.config`?
- The `styled` function is being used to create a styled `div` element with the `flexCss` styles.

3. What are the different variants being defined in the `flexCss` object?
- The `flexCss` object defines variants for `align`, `justify`, `direction`, and `wrap` styles for the `flex` display.
