This code defines an array of `ExpirationOption` objects and exports it as the default export of the module. Each `ExpirationOption` object represents a different expiration time option that can be selected by a user in the larger project. 

Each `ExpirationOption` object has four properties: `text`, `value`, `relativeTime`, and `relativeTimeUnit`. The `text` property is a string that represents the display text for the option. The `value` property is a string that represents the value of the option. The `relativeTime` property is a number that represents the relative time for the option. The `relativeTimeUnit` property is a string that represents the unit of time for the option.

For example, the first `ExpirationOption` object represents an option for a 1 hour expiration time. The `text` property is "1 Hour", the `value` property is "hour", the `relativeTime` property is 1, and the `relativeTimeUnit` property is "h". 

This code can be used in the larger project to provide users with a list of expiration time options to choose from. The `expirationOptions` array can be imported into other modules and used to populate a dropdown menu or other UI element. For example, the following code could be used to create a dropdown menu of expiration time options:

```
import expirationOptions from './path/to/expirationOptions'

const dropdown = document.createElement('select')

expirationOptions.forEach(option => {
  const optionElement = document.createElement('option')
  optionElement.value = option.value
  optionElement.text = option.text
  dropdown.appendChild(optionElement)
})

document.body.appendChild(dropdown)
```

This code creates a `select` element and populates it with `option` elements for each `ExpirationOption` object in the `expirationOptions` array. The `value` and `text` properties of each `option` element are set to the corresponding properties of the `ExpirationOption` object. The resulting dropdown menu can be appended to the `body` of the document or another element in the UI.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ExpirationOption` type?
- The `ExpirationOption` type is likely used to define the structure of objects that represent different expiration options.

2. What is the significance of the `relativeTime` and `relativeTimeUnit` properties?
- The `relativeTime` property represents the amount of time for the expiration option, while the `relativeTimeUnit` property represents the unit of time (e.g. hours, days, weeks, months).

3. How is this module intended to be used in the `zoo` project?
- It is unclear from this code alone how this module is intended to be used in the `zoo` project, but it likely provides a list of expiration options that can be used in some part of the project's functionality.
