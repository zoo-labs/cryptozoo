This code defines a Next.js page component called `IndexPage` that displays a table of collection rankings for various blockchain networks. The component imports several utility functions and components from various modules, including `useCollections` and `useMediaQuery` from `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`, `useMarketplaceChain` and `useMounted` from `hooks`, and `LoadingSpinner` and `Layout` from `components/common`. 

The component fetches collection data from each supported blockchain network using the `useCollections` hook, which takes a query object and returns an object containing the collection data, as well as functions for fetching additional data and checking the loading status. The query object specifies the number of collections to fetch, the sorting method, and whether to include top bids. The component also uses the `useMediaQuery` hook to determine whether to display the sorting options in a compact format based on the screen size.

The component renders a `CollectionRankingsTable` component that displays the collection data in a table format. The table includes columns for the collection name, owner, volume, and change over time, with the volume and change values varying based on the selected sorting method. The component also renders a `CollectionsTimeDropdown` component that allows the user to select the sorting method, and a `ChainToggle` component that allows the user to switch between supported blockchain networks.

The component includes several hooks and state variables for managing the loading and display of the collection data. The `useMounted` hook returns a boolean value indicating whether the component is currently mounted, which is used to conditionally render the `CollectionRankingsTable` component. The `useState` hook is used to manage the selected sorting method, and the `useEffect` hook is used to update the sorting method when the user selects a new option. The component also includes a `useIntersectionObserver` hook that observes a `div` element at the bottom of the table and fetches additional data when the element becomes visible.

The component exports a `getStaticProps` function that fetches collection data for each supported blockchain network using the `fetcher` utility function and returns the data as a prop. The `getStaticProps` function is used to pre-render the page at build time and revalidate the data every 5 seconds. 

Overall, this code provides a high-level interface for displaying and sorting collection data from various blockchain networks, and can be used as a standalone page or integrated into a larger application.
## Questions: 
 1. What libraries and frameworks are being used in this code?
- The code is using Next.js, React, and several other libraries such as `react-responsive`, `usehooks-ts`, and `@reservoir0x/reservoir-sdk`.

2. What is the purpose of the `useCollections` hook and how is it being used in this code?
- The `useCollections` hook is used to fetch and manage collections data from an API. It is being used to fetch collections data based on a query object, and the resulting data is stored in the `data` variable and rendered in the `CollectionRankingsTable` component.

3. What is the purpose of the `fetcher` utility function and where is it being used in this code?
- The `fetcher` utility function is used to make HTTP requests to an API. It is being used in the `getStaticProps` function to fetch collections data from multiple APIs based on a query object and an API key, and the resulting data is stored in the `collections` object.
