The code above is exporting several custom hooks from different files within the `zoo` project. These hooks are designed to provide specific functionality to other parts of the project that may need them. 

The `useMounted` hook is likely used to determine if a component is currently mounted or not. This can be useful for preventing memory leaks or avoiding unnecessary updates to the component. Here is an example of how it might be used:

```
import { useMounted } from 'zoo';

function MyComponent() {
  const isMounted = useMounted();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (isMounted) {
      // do something
    }
  }, [isMounted]);

  return <div>My Component</div>;
}
```

The `useTimeSince` hook is likely used to calculate the time elapsed since a given date. This can be useful for displaying timestamps or determining how long ago an event occurred. Here is an example of how it might be used:

```
import { useTimeSince } from 'zoo';

function MyComponent({ date }) {
  const timeSince = useTimeSince(date);

  return <div>{timeSince} ago</div>;
}
```

The other hooks being exported (`useChainCurrency`, `useMarketplaceChain`, `useENSResolver`, and `useOpenseaFees`) likely provide similar functionality for other parts of the project. Overall, these hooks are designed to make it easier to implement common functionality throughout the `zoo` project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file?
- This code file exports several functions from different modules within the `zoo` project.

2. What do the exported functions do?
- The exported functions are named `useMounted`, `useTimeSince`, `useChainCurrency`, `useMarketplaceChain`, `useENSResolver`, and `useOpenseaFees`. Without further context, it is unclear what each function does.

3. Are there any dependencies or requirements for these functions to work properly?
- It is unclear from this code file whether there are any dependencies or requirements for these functions to work properly. Additional documentation or context may be needed to answer this question.
