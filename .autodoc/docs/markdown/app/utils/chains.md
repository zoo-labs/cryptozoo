This code defines an array of objects that represent different blockchain networks supported by a marketplace application. Each object in the array is of type `ReservoirChain`, which extends the `Chain` type from the `wagmi/chains` module. The `ReservoirChain` type adds additional properties to the `Chain` type, such as `lightIconUrl`, `darkIconUrl`, `reservoirBaseUrl`, `proxyApi`, `routePrefix`, `apiKey`, `coingeckoId`, `collectionSetId`, and `community`. These properties are used to configure various aspects of the marketplace application for each supported blockchain network.

The `DefaultChain` object is the first object in the array and represents the Ethereum mainnet. It includes default values for all the properties of `ReservoirChain`, which can be overridden by subsequent objects in the array. The `DefaultChain` object also includes an `apiKey` property that is set to the value of the `ETH_RESERVOIR_API_KEY` environment variable.

The subsequent objects in the array represent other blockchain networks such as Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Goerli. Each object includes values for the `ReservoirChain` properties that are specific to that network, as well as an `apiKey` property that is set to the value of an environment variable specific to that network.

This code is used to configure the supported blockchain networks for the marketplace application. By modifying the objects in the array, developers can add or remove support for different networks. For example, to remove support for the Polygon network, the object representing Polygon can be removed from the array. To add support for a new network, a new object can be added to the array with the appropriate values for the `ReservoirChain` properties. 

Example usage:
```
import chains from 'zoo/chains'

// Get the default chain object
const defaultChain = chains[0]

// Get the name of the default chain
const defaultChainName = defaultChain.name // 'Ethereum'

// Get the API key for the default chain
const defaultChainApiKey = defaultChain.apiKey // value of ETH_RESERVOIR_API_KEY environment variable

// Get the object representing the Polygon network
const polygonChain = chains.find(chain => chain.name === 'Polygon')

// Get the base URL of the Reservoir API for the Polygon network
const polygonReservoirBaseUrl = polygonChain.reservoirBaseUrl // 'https://api-polygon.reservoir.tools'
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code exports an array of ReservoirChain objects that represent different blockchain networks and their configurations for a marketplace. 

2. What is the ReservoirChain type and what properties does it have?
- The ReservoirChain type is an extension of the Chain type from the 'wagmi/chains' module. It has additional properties such as lightIconUrl, darkIconUrl, reservoirBaseUrl, proxyApi, routePrefix, apiKey, coingeckoId, collectionSetId, and community.

3. What is the purpose of the apiKey property and how is it obtained?
- The apiKey property is used for authentication with the Reservoir API, which is used for fetching data related to the blockchain networks. It is obtained from the process.env object, which is used to access environment variables.
