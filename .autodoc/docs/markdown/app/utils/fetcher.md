This file contains a set of functions that are used to fetch data from APIs. The main function is `fetcher`, which takes in a URL, an optional set of parameters, and an optional set of data. It then sets the headers for the request, adds any parameters to the URL, and makes the request using the `fetch` API. Finally, it returns the response as a JSON object.

The `basicFetcher` function is a simplified version of `fetcher` that does not include any custom headers or parameter handling. It simply makes a request to the given URL and returns the response as a JSON object.

The `fetchWithTimeout` function is similar to `fetcher`, but includes a timeout parameter. It creates an `AbortController` and sets a timeout using `setTimeout`. If the request takes longer than the specified timeout, the controller is aborted and an error is thrown. Otherwise, the request is made using the `fetch` API and the response is returned.

These functions can be used throughout the larger project to fetch data from various APIs. For example, `fetcher` could be used to fetch data from an API that requires custom headers or parameters, while `basicFetcher` could be used for simpler requests. `fetchWithTimeout` could be used in cases where a request may take longer than expected and needs to be cancelled after a certain amount of time.

Example usage of `fetcher`:

```
const data = await fetcher('https://example.com/api/data', { param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2' }, { method: 'POST' });
console.log(data);
```

This would make a POST request to `https://example.com/api/data` with the parameters `param1` and `param2` set to `value1` and `value2`, respectively. The response would be logged to the console as a JSON object.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `setParams` function from `@reservoir0x/reservoir-sdk` being called in the `fetcher` function?
   
   The `setParams` function is used to set query parameters on the `path` URL object based on the `params` object passed into the `fetcher` function.

2. What is the purpose of the `basicFetcher` function and how does it differ from the `fetcher` function?
   
   The `basicFetcher` function is a simplified version of the `fetcher` function that does not include the ability to set custom headers or query parameters. It simply performs a basic fetch request and returns the response data and object.

3. What is the purpose of the `fetchWithTimeout` function and how does it work?
   
   The `fetchWithTimeout` function is used to perform a fetch request with a specified timeout period. It creates an `AbortController` and sets a timeout using `setTimeout`, then passes the `signal` from the controller to the fetch request options. If the request times out, the controller is aborted and an error is thrown.
