The `Wallet` component is responsible for displaying a user's wallet balance and the balances of various cryptocurrencies. The component imports several components from the `components/primitives` directory, as well as several functions and constants from other modules.

The `currencies` constant is an array of objects that represent the cryptocurrencies that will be displayed in the wallet. Each object contains information about the currency, such as its address, symbol, and decimals, as well as information about the chain it belongs to and its CoinGecko ID. The `nonNativeCurrencies` constant is a filtered version of `currencies` that excludes native currencies like ETH and MATIC.

The component uses several hooks to fetch data about the user's balances. The `useAccount` hook returns information about the user's Ethereum account, including the address. The `useContractReads` hook is used to fetch the balances of non-native currencies. The `useBalance` hook is used to fetch the balances of native currencies like ETH and MATIC.

The `usdConversions` constant is an array of objects that represent the conversion rates between the cryptocurrencies in `currencies` and USD. The `useCoinConversion` hook is used to fetch this data from the CoinGecko API.

The `enhancedCurrencies` constant is an array of objects that represent the cryptocurrencies that will be displayed in the wallet, along with additional information like the balance and USD price. The `useMemo` hook is used to memoize this data so that it only needs to be recalculated when certain dependencies change.

The `totalUsdBalance` constant is the sum of the USD prices of all the cryptocurrencies in `enhancedCurrencies`.

The `visibleCurrencies` constant is an array of the cryptocurrencies that will be displayed in the wallet. If `viewAll` is true, all the currencies in `enhancedCurrencies` will be displayed. Otherwise, only the first three will be displayed.

The component renders a header, a total balance, a button to add funds, and a list of the visible currencies. Each currency is displayed as a row with its icon, symbol, balance, and USD price. The `CryptoCurrencyIcon` component is used to display the currency's icon. The `FormatCrypto` and `FormatCurrency` components are used to format the balance and USD price, respectively.

The `setViewAll` function is used to toggle the `viewAll` state when the "View All Tokens" button is clicked.

Overall, the `Wallet` component provides a simple way for users to view their cryptocurrency balances and add funds to their wallet. It is highly configurable and can be easily adapted to support additional cryptocurrencies and chains.
## Questions: 
 1. What external libraries or APIs does this code rely on?
- This code imports several components and hooks from the 'components/primitives' and 'wagmi' libraries, as well as the 'ethers' library for working with Ethereum. It also uses the 'useCoinConversion' hook from a custom 'hooks' directory.

2. What currencies are currently supported by this wallet?
- The wallet currently supports ETH and WETH on the Ethereum mainnet, MATIC and WETH on the Polygon network, and WETH on the Optimism network. These currencies are defined in the 'currencies' array at the top of the file.

3. How does the wallet calculate the USD value of each currency?
- The wallet uses the 'useCoinConversion' hook to fetch the current USD price of each currency from the CoinGecko API. It then multiplies the user's balance of each currency by its USD price to calculate the total USD value of that currency.
