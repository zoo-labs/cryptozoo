The `GlobalSearch` component is a search bar that allows users to search for collections and wallets on the platform. It imports several components from the `primitives` and `components` directories, as well as several hooks and libraries from external packages.

The component takes in a `collection` and a `handleSelectResult` prop. The `collection` prop is an object that contains information about a collection, such as its name, image, and token count. The `handleSelectResult` prop is a function that is called when a user selects a search result. It takes in the selected result as an argument and updates the state of the component accordingly.

The `GlobalSearch` component renders an `Input` component that allows users to enter search queries. As the user types, the component sends a request to the server to retrieve search results that match the query. The search results are displayed in a dropdown menu below the search bar.

The component also displays recent search results when the user clicks on the search bar. Recent search results are stored in local storage and retrieved when the component mounts. When a user selects a search result, the selected result is added to the list of recent search results.

The `CollectionItem` component is a child component of `GlobalSearch` that renders a single search result for a collection. It displays the collection's name, image, token count, and volume in a formatted manner. The `WalletItem` component is another child component that renders a single search result for a wallet. It displays the wallet's name and avatar.

The `SearchResult` component is a child component that renders a single search result. It takes in a `result` prop that contains information about the search result, such as its type (collection or wallet) and data (collection or wallet object). It also takes in a `handleSelectResult` prop that is called when the user selects the search result.

Overall, the `GlobalSearch` component is a reusable search bar that allows users to search for collections and wallets on the platform. It provides a user-friendly interface for searching and displaying search results.
