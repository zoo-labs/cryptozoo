The `TransactionProgress` component is a React functional component that renders a progress bar with images. It takes in two arrays of image URLs, `fromImgs` and `toImgs`, and renders them on either side of the progress bar. The progress bar is made up of three dots that animate in a loop to give the impression of loading.

The component uses the `styled` function from the `stitches.config` module to create two styled components, `Img` and `ProgressDot`. The `Img` component is a styled `img` tag with a fixed width and height, a border radius, and object-fit set to cover. The `ProgressDot` component is a styled `Box` component with a border radius, width, and height set to 5 pixels to create a circular dot.

The component uses the `Flex` component from the `primitives` module to create a flex container that aligns its children vertically centered. It then maps over the `fromImgs` and `toImgs` arrays to render the images on either side of the progress bar. The `Img` component is used to render the images, and the `Flex` component is used to group the three `ProgressDot` components together in the center of the progress bar.

The `ProgressDot` components use three keyframe animations, `loadingStart`, `loadingMiddle`, and `loadingEnd`, to create the loading animation. Each animation defines a different set of styles for the dot at different points in time. The `animation` CSS property is used to apply the animations to the `ProgressDot` components.

Overall, this component can be used to show the progress of a transaction or any other process that involves loading data. The component is highly customizable, and the images and animation can be easily changed to fit the needs of the project. Below is an example of how the `TransactionProgress` component can be used in a React application:

```jsx
import TransactionProgress from './TransactionProgress'

const App = () => {
  const fromImgs = ['img1.jpg', 'img2.jpg', 'img3.jpg']
  const toImgs = ['img4.jpg', 'img5.jpg', 'img6.jpg']
  return (
    <div>
      <TransactionProgress fromImgs={fromImgs} toImgs={toImgs} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code exports a React component called `TransactionProgress` that displays a progress bar with dots that animate using keyframes, along with images before and after the progress bar.

2. What external dependencies does this code rely on?
- This code imports `Box` and `Flex` components from a file located in a `primitives` directory, and also imports `styled` and `keyframes` functions from a `stitches.config` file.

3. What are the props that can be passed to the `TransactionProgress` component?
- The `TransactionProgress` component accepts two arrays of strings called `fromImgs` and `toImgs`, which represent the images to be displayed before and after the progress bar, respectively. It also accepts all the props that can be passed to a `Flex` component.
