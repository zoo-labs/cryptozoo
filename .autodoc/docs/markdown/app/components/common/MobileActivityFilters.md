The `MobileActivityFilters` component is a React component that renders a modal dialog with a list of filters for activity types. It receives two props: `activityTypes` and `setActivityTypes`. The `activityTypes` prop is an array of strings that represents the currently selected activity types, and the `setActivityTypes` prop is a function that is called when the user selects or deselects an activity type.

The component uses the `FullscreenModal` component from the `components/common` module to render the modal dialog. The `FullscreenModal` component takes a `trigger` prop that is a React element that triggers the modal when clicked. In this case, the trigger is a button with the label "Filter" and a badge that shows the number of selected activity types.

The modal dialog contains a list of activity types with checkboxes that allow the user to select or deselect them. The list is defined in the `filters` array, which contains objects with the following properties: `type`, `name`, and `icon`. The `type` property is a string that represents the activity type, the `name` property is a string that represents the display name of the activity type, and the `icon` property is an object that represents the icon of the activity type.

Each activity type in the list is rendered as a `Flex` component with an icon, a label, and a checkbox. The `Switch` component is used to render the checkbox. When the user selects or deselects an activity type, the `setActivityTypes` function is called with the updated array of selected activity types.

The component also renders a "Clear all" button that allows the user to deselect all activity types at once. When the user clicks the "Clear all" button, the `setActivityTypes` function is called with an empty array.

Overall, the `MobileActivityFilters` component provides a user interface for selecting activity types and filtering a list of activities based on those types. It can be used in a larger project that displays a list of activities, such as a marketplace or a social network.
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code exports a React component called `MobileActivityFilters` that renders a fullscreen modal with a list of filters for different types of activities. The user can select or deselect filters to show or hide activities of those types.

2. What external libraries does this code use?
- This code imports several external libraries, including `react`, `@radix-ui/react-dialog`, `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`, and `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`. It also imports some components from a local file located at `components/primitives` and a hook from another local file located at `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui`.

3. What types are defined in this code?
- This code defines three types: `ActivityTypes`, `Filters`, and `Props`. `ActivityTypes` is a union type that represents the different types of activities that can be filtered. `Filters` is an array of objects that represent the different filters that can be applied to activities. `Props` is an object that contains two properties: `activityTypes`, which is an array of `ActivityTypes` that are currently selected, and `setActivityTypes`, which is a function that updates the `activityTypes` array.
