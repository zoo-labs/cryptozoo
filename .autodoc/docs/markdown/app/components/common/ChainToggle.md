The `ChainToggle` component is a React functional component that renders a toggle group of supported blockchain networks. It is used to switch between different blockchain networks in the larger project. 

The component imports several dependencies including `FC` from `react`, `ToggleGroup`, `ToggleGroupItem`, `Box`, and `Text` from `../primitives`, `supportedChains` from `utils/chains`, `useContext` from `react`, `ChainContext` from `context/ChainContextProvider`, `TooltipArrow` from `components/primitives/Tooltip`, `useMounted` from `hooks`, `useTheme` from `next-themes`, and `useRouter` from `next/router`.

The component first initializes several variables including `router` using `useRouter()`, `chain` and `switchCurrentChain` using `useContext(ChainContext)`, `isMounted` using `useMounted()`, and `theme` using `useTheme()`. 

The component then checks if the component is mounted and if there is only one supported chain. If either of these conditions is true, the component returns `null`.

If there are multiple supported chains, the component renders a `ToggleGroup` with `type="single"` and `value={chain.name}`. The `ToggleGroup` renders a `ToggleGroupItem` for each supported chain. Each `ToggleGroupItem` contains an image of the chain's icon and its name. 

When a `ToggleGroupItem` is clicked, the `switchCurrentChain` function is called with the `id` of the selected chain. If the `router.query.chain` exists, it is removed from the query parameters and the router is updated with the new query parameters. 

Each `ToggleGroupItem` also contains a tooltip that displays the name of the chain when hovered over. The tooltip is implemented using the `TooltipPrimitive` components from `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`. 

Overall, the `ChainToggle` component provides a user-friendly way to switch between different blockchain networks in the larger project. 

Example usage:

```jsx
import ChainToggle from './ChainToggle'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My App</h1>
      <ChainToggle />
      {/* rest of the app */}
    </div>
  )
}

export default App
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ChainToggle` component?
- The `ChainToggle` component is responsible for rendering a toggle group of supported chains and their icons, allowing the user to switch between them.

2. What is the `ChainContext` and how is it used in this code?
- The `ChainContext` is a context provided by the `ChainContextProvider` that allows components to access and modify the current chain state. In this code, the `ChainToggle` component uses the `useContext` hook to access the `chain` state and `switchCurrentChain` function.

3. What is the purpose of the `TooltipPrimitive` component and how is it used in this code?
- The `TooltipPrimitive` component is a part of the `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` library and is used to render a tooltip with additional information about each chain option when the user hovers over it. It is used in this code to wrap each `ToggleGroupItem` component and provide the tooltip content.
