The `CopyText` component is a React functional component that provides a way to copy text to the clipboard. It is imported from the `components/primitives` module, which contains other reusable UI components. 

The component takes in three props: `children`, `text`, and `css`. The `children` prop is a ReactNode, which means it can be any valid React component or JSX expression. The `text` prop is a string that represents the text to be copied to the clipboard. The `css` prop is an optional CSS object that can be used to style the component.

The component uses the `useCopyToClipboard` hook from the `usehooks-ts` module to copy the `text` prop to the clipboard. The hook returns a tuple containing the current value of the clipboard and a function to copy a new value to the clipboard. The `handleCopy` function calls the `copy` function with the `text` prop, sets the `isCopied` state to `true`, and then sets it back to `false` after one second using `setTimeout`.

The component renders a `Tooltip` component from the `components/primitives` module that displays a message when the user hovers over the component. The `Tooltip` component takes in several props, including `open`, `align`, `side`, and `content`. The `open` prop is a boolean that determines whether the tooltip is visible. The `align` prop is a string that determines the horizontal alignment of the tooltip relative to the component. The `side` prop is a string that determines the vertical alignment of the tooltip relative to the component. The `content` prop is a ReactNode that represents the content of the tooltip.

The `Box` component from the `components/primitives` module is used to wrap the `children` prop. The `Box` component has several props, including `onClick`, `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`, `onTouchStart`, and `css`. The `onClick` prop is a function that is called when the component is clicked. The `onMouseEnter` and `onMouseLeave` props are functions that are called when the user hovers over or leaves the component. The `onTouchStart` prop is a function that is called when the user touches the component on a touch screen device. The `css` prop is an optional CSS object that can be used to style the component.

Overall, the `CopyText` component provides a simple way to copy text to the clipboard and display a message to the user when the text has been copied. It can be used in any React project that requires this functionality. 

Example usage:

```
import CopyText from 'components/CopyText'

function MyComponent() {
  const textToCopy = 'Hello, world!'
  return (
    <CopyText text={textToCopy}>
      <button>Copy text</button>
    </CopyText>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What does this code do?
- This code exports a React component called `CopyText` that renders a clickable box with a tooltip that allows the user to copy a given text to the clipboard.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
- This code imports several components from the `components/primitives` library, as well as the `useCopyToClipboard` hook from the `usehooks-ts` library. It also uses the `CSS` type from the `@stitches/react` library.

3. What props does the `CopyText` component accept?
- The `CopyText` component accepts three props: `children` (a ReactNode), `text` (a string), and `css` (a CSS object). The `children` prop is used to render the content of the clickable box, while the `text` prop is the text that will be copied to the clipboard when the box is clicked. The `css` prop is an optional object that allows the user to pass custom CSS styles to the component.
