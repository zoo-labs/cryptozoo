The `OffersTable` component is a React functional component that displays a table of offers for a given token. The component takes in several props, including the token, whether the token is an ERC-1155 token, and whether the user is the owner of the token. 

The component uses the `useBids` hook from the `@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui` library to fetch the offers for the given token. The `useBids` hook takes in a query object that specifies the criteria for the bids to be fetched. The query object includes the token, whether to include metadata and raw data, and the sorting criteria. The `useBids` hook returns an object that includes the data for the bids, a function to fetch the next page of bids, and a function to mutate the data.

The `OffersTable` component renders a table of the offers using the `TableRow` component. Each row of the table displays the price of the offer, the maker of the offer, and the expiration time of the offer. If the user is the owner of the token, they can accept the offer. If the user is the maker of the offer, they can edit or cancel the offer. 

The `OfferTableRow` component is a child component of the `OffersTable` component that renders a single row of the table. The component uses the `useENSResolver` hook to resolve the maker's ENS name and the `useMarketplaceChain` hook to get the base URL for the marketplace. The component also uses the `useTimeSince` hook to calculate the time since the offer's expiration. 

Overall, the `OffersTable` component provides a convenient way for users to view and manage offers for a given token.
