[View code on GitHub](zoo-labs/zoo/blob/master/app/components/token/AttributeCard.tsx)

The code is a React component that renders a card displaying information about a specific attribute of a collection of tokens. The component takes in several props, including the attribute being displayed, the total number of tokens in the collection, and the ID of the collection. 

The component first imports several modules, including components from a primitives library, a hook for retrieving token data, and a utility function for formatting numbers. It then defines the types of the props being passed in, including the shape of the token object. 

Inside the component, it uses the `useMarketplaceChain` hook to retrieve the route prefix for the current marketplace. It then calculates the rarity of the attribute being displayed by dividing the number of tokens with that attribute by the total number of tokens in the collection. It formats this number as a percentage using the `formatNumber` utility function. 

The component then constructs a link to the collection page with a query parameter for the specific attribute being displayed. It renders a Flex container with several Text and FormatCryptoCurrency components to display the attribute name, value, rarity, and floor price. The Flex container is wrapped in a Link component to make it clickable. 

This component can be used in a larger project to display information about a collection of tokens, allowing users to easily navigate to the collection page and view specific attributes. It can be customized with different styles and props to fit the design and functionality of the project. 

Example usage:

```
<AttributeCard 
  attribute={{ key: 'Color', value: 'Red', tokenCount: 10, floorAskPrice: 0.5 }}
  collectionTokenCount={100}
  collectionId="abc123"
/>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What are the dependencies of this file?
- This file imports components from 'components/primitives', uses a hook from '@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui', and imports a utility function from 'utils/numbers'.

2. What is the purpose of the Props interface?
- The Props interface defines the expected shape of the props object that will be passed to the default export of this file. It includes an attribute object, a collectionTokenCount number or string, and an optional collectionId string.

3. What is the purpose of the Flex component and its associated CSS?
- The Flex component is used to create a container with flexible layout properties. The associated CSS sets the background color, padding, border radius, and gap between child elements, among other properties.
