The code is a React component that displays the rarity rank of a token within a collection. The component takes in three props: `token`, `collection`, and `collectionAttributes`. 

The `token` prop is an object that contains data about the token, including its rarity rank. The `collection` prop is an object that contains data about the collection that the token belongs to, including the total number of tokens in the collection. The `collectionAttributes` prop is an array of objects that contain additional attributes of the collection.

The component calculates the percentile rank of the token's rarity within the collection by dividing the token's rarity rank by the total number of tokens in the collection and multiplying by 100. It then uses a function called `topPercentile` to determine the top percentile that the token falls into based on its percentile rank. The `topPercentile` function returns a number that represents the top percentile, such as 5 for the top 5%.

The component then checks if the collection is enabled for rarity ranking by ensuring that the collection has at least two tokens and two attributes. If the collection is not enabled for rarity ranking or if the token's rarity rank is undefined, null, or if the token is an ERC1155 token, the component returns null.

If the token is eligible for rarity ranking, the component displays the rarity rank and top percentile in a tooltip that appears when the user hovers over a "Rank" button. The tooltip also displays the total number of tokens in the collection and the source of the ranking data.

This component can be used in a larger project that involves displaying information about tokens and collections. It provides a way to quickly view the rarity rank of a token within a collection and can be used to sort and filter tokens based on their rarity. The component can be customized to fit the design of the larger project by changing the styles and content of the tooltip and the "Rank" button. 

Example usage:

```
import RarityRank from 'components/RarityRank'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const token = { token: { rarityRank: 42 } }
  const collection = { tokenCount: '100' }
  const collectionAttributes = [{}, {}]

  return (
    <div>
      <RarityRank token={token} collection={collection} collectionAttributes={collectionAttributes} />
    </div>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `topPercentile` function?
- The `topPercentile` function calculates the top percentile of rarity rank based on the input percentile value.

2. What is the significance of the `rarityEnabledCollection` variable?
- The `rarityEnabledCollection` variable is used to determine if the collection has enough tokens and attributes to enable rarity ranking.

3. What is the output of the `Tooltip` component?
- The `Tooltip` component displays a tooltip with information about the rarity rank of the token, including the top percentile, rarity rank, and the source of the data (Poprank).
