The code above defines a React functional component called `ConnectWalletButton`. This component renders a custom button that allows users to connect their wallet to the application. The button is implemented using the `ConnectButton` component from the `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` library.

The `ConnectWalletButton` component takes no props and returns a JSX element that renders the `ConnectButton.Custom` component. This component takes a function as a child that receives an object with four properties: `account`, `chain`, `openConnectModal`, and `mounted`. These properties are used to determine whether the user's wallet is connected and whether the button should be rendered.

If the `mounted`, `account`, and `chain` properties are all truthy, the component returns `null`, which means that the button is not rendered. Otherwise, the component returns a `Button` component from the `components/primitives/Button` module. This button has the text "Connect Wallet" and an `onClick` handler that calls the `openConnectModal` function when clicked.

The `ConnectWalletButton` component is likely used in a larger application that requires users to connect their wallets to interact with the blockchain. This component provides a simple and customizable way to implement a wallet connection button that can be styled and positioned as needed. Here is an example of how the `ConnectWalletButton` component can be used in a React application:

```
import React from 'react';
import ConnectWalletButton from './ConnectWalletButton';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <ConnectWalletButton />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `ConnectButton` component from the `@rainbow-me/rainbowkit` library?
- The `ConnectButton` component is used to render a custom connect button for a wallet.

2. What is the purpose of the `ConnectWalletButton` component?
- The `ConnectWalletButton` component is a functional component that renders a custom connect wallet button using the `ConnectButton` component.

3. What happens when the `ConnectWalletButton` is clicked?
- When the `ConnectWalletButton` is clicked, it opens a connect modal if the `mounted`, `account`, and `chain` variables are truthy. If any of these variables are falsy, the button does not do anything.
