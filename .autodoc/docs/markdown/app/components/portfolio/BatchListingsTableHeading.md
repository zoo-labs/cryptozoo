The code defines a React functional component called `BatchListingsTableHeading` that renders a table header row for a batch of listings. The component takes two props: `displayQuantity` and `gridTemplateColumns`. The `displayQuantity` prop is a boolean that determines whether to display the quantity column in the table. The `gridTemplateColumns` prop is a string that sets the CSS grid template columns for the header row.

The component uses the `HeaderRow`, `TableCell`, and `Text` components from the `components/primitives` module to render the table header cells. The `HeaderRow` component sets the CSS styles for the header row, including making it sticky to the top of the page and setting the background color to a neutral color. The `TableCell` component renders each table header cell, and the `Text` component sets the text content and style for each cell.

The component conditionally renders the quantity column based on the `displayQuantity` prop. If `displayQuantity` is true, the component renders a `TableCell` with the text "Quantity". Otherwise, it does not render anything for the quantity column.

The component also renders table header cells for the item name, price, expiration date, creator royalties, marketplace fee, and profit. These cells are always rendered regardless of the `displayQuantity` prop.

Overall, this component is used to render a consistent table header for a batch of listings in the larger project. It allows for customization of the grid template columns and the display of the quantity column based on the needs of the specific use case. Here is an example usage of the component:

```
<BatchListingsTableHeading
  displayQuantity={true}
  gridTemplateColumns="repeat(7, 1fr) auto"
/>
```
