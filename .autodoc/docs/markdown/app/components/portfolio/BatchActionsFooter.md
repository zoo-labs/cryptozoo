The `BatchActionsFooter` component is a React functional component that renders a footer with batch actions for a list of selected items. It takes in four props: `isOwner`, a boolean that determines whether the user is the owner of the selected items; `selectedItems`, an array of `UserToken` objects that represent the selected items; `setSelectedItems`, a function that sets the selected items; and `setShowListingPage`, a function that sets whether to show the listing page.

The component first calculates the number of selected items and the subject of the items (singular or plural) based on the number of selected items. If the user is not the owner of the selected items, the component returns `null`.

Otherwise, the component renders a fixed-position footer with two sections. The first section displays the number of selected items and a "Clear" button that clears the selected items when clicked. The second section displays a "List" button that is disabled if no items are selected. When clicked, the "List" button sets `setShowListingPage` to `true`.

This component can be used in a larger project that requires batch actions for a list of selected items. For example, in an e-commerce website, the user may select multiple items to add to their cart or to compare prices. The `BatchActionsFooter` component can be used to display the number of selected items and provide actions to clear the selection or to perform an action on the selected items. 

Example usage:

```jsx
<BatchActionsFooter
  isOwner={true}
  selectedItems={[{ id: 1, name: 'Item 1' }, { id: 2, name: 'Item 2' }]}
  setSelectedItems={setSelectedItems}
  setShowListingPage={setShowListingPage}
/>
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this component and how is it used within the larger project?
   - This component is called `BatchActionsFooter` and it appears to be a UI component that renders a footer with batch actions for a list of selected items. A smart developer might want to know where this component is used and how it fits into the larger project.
   
2. What are the expected types for the `selectedItems`, `setSelectedItems`, and `setShowListingPage` props?
   - The `selectedItems` prop is an array of `UserToken` objects, the `setSelectedItems` prop is a function that sets the `selectedItems` state, and the `setShowListingPage` prop is a function that sets the `showListingPage` state. A smart developer might want to know the expected types for these props in order to use this component correctly.

3. What is the purpose of the `isOwner` prop and how does it affect the rendering of this component?
   - The `isOwner` prop is a boolean that determines whether or not the user is the owner of the selected items. If `isOwner` is `false`, the component returns `null` and does not render anything. A smart developer might want to know how this prop affects the rendering of the component and what other props or conditions might affect its behavior.
