This code is a module that exports a custom dialog component built using the `@radix-ui/react-dialog` and `@stitches/react` libraries. The `Dialog` component is a modal dialog that can be used to display content on top of the current page. It is built using a combination of styled components and Framer Motion animations to create a visually appealing and responsive user interface.

The `Dialog` component takes several props, including `trigger`, `portalProps`, `overlayProps`, `open`, and `onOpenChange`. The `trigger` prop is used to specify the element that will trigger the dialog to open when clicked. The `portalProps` and `overlayProps` props are used to specify additional properties for the dialog portal and overlay components, respectively. The `open` prop is used to specify whether the dialog is currently open or closed, while the `onOpenChange` prop is used to specify a callback function that will be called when the dialog is opened or closed.

The `Dialog` component is built using several other components, including `Overlay`, `AnimatedOverlay`, `Content`, and `AnimatedContent`. The `Overlay` and `Content` components are styled components that define the appearance and layout of the dialog overlay and content, respectively. The `AnimatedOverlay` and `AnimatedContent` components are higher-order components that wrap the `Overlay` and `Content` components and add Framer Motion animations to them.

The `Dialog` component uses the `AnimatePresence` component from Framer Motion to animate the opening and closing of the dialog. When the `open` prop is set to `true`, the `Dialog` component renders the `AnimatedOverlay` and `AnimatedContent` components inside a `DialogPrimitive.DialogPortal` component. The `AnimatedOverlay` and `AnimatedContent` components are wrapped in `motion.div` components that define the animations for the overlay and content, respectively.

Overall, this code provides a flexible and customizable dialog component that can be used to display content on top of the current page. The use of styled components and Framer Motion animations allows for a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Here is an example of how the `Dialog` component can be used:

```
import { Dialog } from 'zoo'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Dialog trigger={<button>Open Dialog</button>}>
      <h1>Dialog Content</h1>
      <p>This is some content inside the dialog.</p>
    </Dialog>
  )
}
```
