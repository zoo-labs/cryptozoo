This code exports a styled `span` component using the `stitches.config` library. The purpose of this code is to provide a flexible and reusable way to style text elements in the larger project. 

The `styled` function takes two arguments: the HTML element to be styled (in this case, `span`) and an object containing the CSS properties and values to be applied to the element. The CSS properties include `color`, `fontFamily`, and `letterSpacing`, which are set to specific values using the `$` syntax. This syntax is used to reference values defined in the `stitches.config` file.

The `variants` object defines different styles for the text element based on different variant names. The `style` variant includes different heading levels (`h2`, `h3`, etc.) as well as different subtitle and body styles. The `color` variant includes a `subtle` and `error` option, which changes the color of the text. The `italic` variant includes a `true` option, which sets the font style to italic. The `ellipsify` variant includes a `true` option, which adds ellipses to text that overflows its container.

The `defaultVariants` object sets the default style to `body1`, which has a font weight of 400 and a font size of 16.

This code can be used throughout the larger project to style text elements consistently and with flexibility. For example, a component that displays a user's name and profile picture could use this styled `span` to display the name with a `h3` style and the username with a `subtitle1` style. The `color` variant could be used to display an error message in red, and the `italic` variant could be used to emphasize certain text. The `ellipsify` variant could be used to truncate long text in a container with a fixed width. Overall, this code provides a powerful tool for styling text elements in a consistent and flexible way throughout the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `styled` function and where does it come from?
   - The `styled` function is imported from a module called `stitches.config` and is used to create styled components in React.
2. What are the available variants for the `style` property and what styles do they apply?
   - The available variants for the `style` property are `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `subtitle1`, `subtitle2`, `subtitle3`, `body1`, `body2`, and `body3`. Each variant applies a different combination of font weight and font size styles.
3. What are the available variants for the `color` property and what colors do they apply?
   - The available variants for the `color` property are `subtle` and `error`. The `subtle` variant applies a gray color (`$gray11`) and the `error` variant applies a red color (`$red11`).
