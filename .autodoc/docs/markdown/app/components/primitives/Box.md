This code imports the `styled` function from the `stitches.config` module and exports a styled `div` element using that function. The `styled` function is a utility provided by the `stitches` library that allows developers to create custom styled components using CSS-in-JS syntax. 

In this case, the `styled` function is being used to create a custom styled `div` element with an empty object as its CSS rules. This means that the `div` element will not have any specific styles applied to it by default, but can be further customized by passing in additional CSS rules as props when the component is used elsewhere in the project.

This code is likely just one small piece of a larger project that uses the `stitches` library to create and manage custom styled components. By using the `styled` function to create these components, developers can easily apply consistent styles across the entire project and make changes to those styles in a centralized location. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:

```
import CustomDiv from './CustomDiv'

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CustomDiv css={{ backgroundColor: 'blue', padding: '10px' }}>
        This is a custom styled div!
      </CustomDiv>
    </div>
  )
}
```

In this example, the `CustomDiv` component created by the code in the `zoo` file is imported and used within the `App` component. The `CustomDiv` component is passed a `css` prop with additional styles to apply to the `div` element, resulting in a blue background color and 10 pixels of padding. This allows developers to easily create and customize styled components throughout the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `styled` function and where does it come from?
   - The `styled` function is likely used to apply custom styles to a DOM element. It is imported from a file located at `stitches.config`.
2. What is the significance of passing an empty object as the second argument to the `styled` function?
   - Without any properties defined in the object, the `styled` function will simply return a styled `div` element with no additional styles applied.
3. What is the expected behavior of exporting the result of the `styled` function as the default export of this file?
   - The default export of this file will be the styled `div` element, which can be imported and used in other parts of the codebase.
