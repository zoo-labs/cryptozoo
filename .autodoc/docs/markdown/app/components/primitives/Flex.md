This code defines a set of CSS properties for creating flexible layouts using the `styled` function from the `stitches.config` library and the `motion` library from `framer-motion`. The `flexCss` object contains a set of CSS properties for creating flexible layouts using the `display: flex` property. The `variants` object contains a set of properties for aligning and justifying items within the layout, setting the direction of the layout, and wrapping items within the layout. 

The `styled` function is used to create a new styled component that extends the `div` element and applies the `flexCss` object as its styles. This component can be used to create flexible layouts by applying the `align`, `justify`, `direction`, and `wrap` variants to its children. 

Additionally, the code exports a new component called `AnimatedFlex` that extends the `motion.div` element and applies the same `flexCss` object as its styles. This component can be used to create animated flexible layouts using the `framer-motion` library. 

Overall, this code provides a convenient way to create flexible layouts using CSS properties and can be used throughout the larger project to create consistent and responsive designs. 

Example usage:

```
import Flex from './Flex'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Flex align="center" justify="center" direction="column">
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <p>This is a flexible layout</p>
    </Flex>
  )
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `motion` and `stitches.config` imports?
   - The `motion` import is from the `framer-motion` library and is likely used for animating components. The `styled` import is from the `stitches.config` file and is likely used for styling components with CSS-in-JS.
2. What is the `flexCss` object used for?
   - The `flexCss` object defines variants for different flexbox properties such as `align-items`, `justify-content`, `flex-direction`, and `flex-wrap`. It is likely used to easily apply these variants to styled components.
3. What is the purpose of the `AnimatedFlex` export?
   - The `AnimatedFlex` export is a styled component that extends the `motion.div` component and applies the `flexCss` object to it. This allows for the component to be animated and styled with flexbox properties.
