This code defines a custom checkbox component using the Stitches CSS-in-JS library and the Radix UI Checkbox component. The component is exported as the default export of the module.

The CheckboxRoot constant defines the styles for the root element of the checkbox component. It sets the background color, width, height, and border radius of the checkbox, as well as its display and alignment properties. It also sets the default border color and style, and defines styles for when the checkbox is checked.

The CheckboxIndicator constant defines the styles for the indicator element of the checkbox component. It sets the color of the checkmark icon to white.

The Checkbox function is the main component function that returns the custom checkbox component. It takes an optional props argument that is passed to the CheckboxRoot element. The CheckboxIndicator element is a child of the CheckboxRoot element and renders a FontAwesomeIcon component with the faCheck icon.

This custom checkbox component can be used in the larger project by importing it and using it in place of the default HTML checkbox input element. It provides a more customizable and visually appealing checkbox that can be styled to match the design of the project. Here is an example of how the Checkbox component can be used:

```
import Checkbox from 'path/to/Checkbox'

function MyForm() {
  const [isChecked, setIsChecked] = useState(false)

  function handleCheckboxChange() {
    setIsChecked(!isChecked)
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <Checkbox checked={isChecked} onChange={handleCheckboxChange} />
      <label htmlFor="my-checkbox">My Checkbox</label>
    </form>
  )
}
```

In this example, the Checkbox component is used in a form and its checked state is controlled by a state variable and an onChange handler. The label element is associated with the checkbox using the htmlFor attribute.
