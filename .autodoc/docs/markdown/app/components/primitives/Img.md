The code in this file defines a React component called `Img` that renders an image. The component takes in props, which are passed to a `StyledImg` component that is styled using the `stitches.config` library. If the image fails to load, the component will display a fallback icon instead.

The `Img` component also has some conditional rendering logic. If the `src` prop is not provided or if the image fails to load, the component will display a fallback icon. The type of icon displayed depends on the value of the `alt` prop. If `alt` is set to `'Collection Page Image'`, the component will display a larger icon. If `alt` is set to `'Activity Token Image'` or `'Searchbar Collection Image'`, the component will display a smaller icon. If `alt` is set to any other value, the component will display a default-sized icon.

The `Img` component is exported as the default export of the file, which means it can be imported and used in other files in the project. For example, if a component in another file needs to display an image, it can import the `Img` component and use it like this:

```
import Img from 'path/to/Img'

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Img src="path/to/image.jpg" alt="An image" width={500} height={500} />
  )
}
```

This will render an image with the specified source, alt text, and dimensions. If the image fails to load, the fallback icon will be displayed instead.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   
   This code defines a React component called `Img` that renders an image with fallback options if the image fails to load.

2. What external libraries or dependencies does this code use?
   
   This code imports several dependencies including `@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons`, `@fortawesome/react-fontawesome`, `components/primitives/Flex`, `next/image`, `react`, and `stitches.config`.

3. What are the fallback options for images that fail to load?
   
   If the image fails to load, the `Img` component will render a FontAwesomeIcon with a background color and size based on the `alt` prop passed to it. If no `alt` prop is provided or the `alt` prop does not match any of the specified values, the FontAwesomeIcon will be rendered with a default background color.
