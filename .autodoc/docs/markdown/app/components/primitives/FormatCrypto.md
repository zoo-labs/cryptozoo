The `FormatCrypto` component is a React functional component that formats a given cryptocurrency value and renders it as a `Text` component. It takes in several props, including the `amount` of cryptocurrency to be formatted, `maximumFractionDigits` to specify the maximum number of decimal places to display, `decimals` to specify the number of decimal places in the original value, `css` to apply custom CSS styles to the `Text` component, `textStyle` to specify the style of the `Text` component, and `children` to render any child components.

The `FormatCrypto` component uses the `formatBN` function from the `numbers` utility file to format the `amount` value. The `formatBN` function takes in the `amount`, `maximumFractionDigits`, and `decimals` props and returns a formatted string value of the `amount` with the specified number of decimal places.

The `FormatCrypto` component then renders a `Flex` component with the `align` prop set to "center" and custom CSS styles to set the gap between child components and the minimum width of the `Flex` component. If the formatted `value` is not equal to "-", the `children` prop is rendered. Finally, a `Text` component is rendered with the `style` and `css` props set to the `textStyle` and `css` props passed to the `FormatCrypto` component, respectively. The `value` prop is set to the formatted `value`.

This component can be used in a larger project to display cryptocurrency values in a consistent and formatted manner. For example, it can be used in a wallet application to display the balance of a user's cryptocurrency holdings. Here is an example usage of the `FormatCrypto` component:

```
<FormatCrypto amount={123.456789} maximumFractionDigits={2} decimals={8} textStyle="body2" css={{ color: '$primary' }}>
  Total Balance:
</FormatCrypto>
```

This would render a `Flex` component with the child component "Total Balance:" and a `Text` component with the formatted value "123.46" and custom CSS styles to set the text color to the primary color of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a React component called `FormatCrypto` that formats a cryptocurrency value and renders it along with optional children.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   This code imports `BigNumberish` from the `ethers` library, and `formatBN` from a custom `numbers` utility module. It also imports `React`, `FC`, `Flex`, and `Text` from a custom `index` module.

3. What are the optional props that can be passed to the `FormatCrypto` component?
   The optional props are `maximumFractionDigits`, `decimals`, `css`, `textStyle`, and `children`. `maximumFractionDigits` specifies the maximum number of decimal places to display, `decimals` specifies the number of decimal places in the input value, `css` and `textStyle` specify the CSS styles to apply to the rendered text, and `children` is any additional content to render alongside the formatted value.
