This code is responsible for creating and configuring the theme for the `zoo` project. It uses the `@stitches/react` library to create a theme object that contains various properties such as colors, fonts, sizes, and media queries. The `createStitches` function is used to create the theme object and also returns several utility functions that can be used to create styles for components.

The `colors` property of the theme object is defined using the `@radix-ui/colors` library, which provides a set of predefined color scales. These color scales are then combined and aliased to create the final color palette for the project. The `createTheme` function is used to create a dark theme that is a variation of the main theme.

The `utils` property of the theme object contains various utility functions that can be used to create styles for components. These functions include margin, padding, width, height, and grid-related functions. The `media` property contains various media queries that can be used to create responsive styles for components.

The `globalCss` function is used to apply a global CSS reset to the project. The `Inter` font from Google Fonts is also imported and used as the default font for the project.

Overall, this code provides a centralized way to manage the theme for the `zoo` project. It allows for easy customization of the color palette and provides utility functions that can be used to create consistent styles for components. Here is an example of how the `styled` function can be used to create a styled component using the theme:

```
import { styled } from 'zoo'

const Button = styled('button', {
  backgroundColor: '$primary1',
  color: '$whiteA11',
  padding: '$2',
  borderRadius: '$radii',
  '&:hover': {
    backgroundColor: '$primary2',
  },
})
```
