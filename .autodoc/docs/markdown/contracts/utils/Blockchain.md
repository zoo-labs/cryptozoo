The `Blockchain` class in the `zoo` project is responsible for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain through the `ethers` library. It provides methods for saving and reverting snapshots of the blockchain state, resetting the blockchain to its initial state, increasing the time on the blockchain, and waiting for a certain number of blocks to be mined.

The constructor takes a `providers.JsonRpcProvider` object as an argument, which is used to send JSON-RPC requests to the Ethereum node. The `sendJSONRpcRequestAsync` method is a private helper method that sends a JSON-RPC request to the provider and returns the response.

The `saveSnapshotAsync` method saves a snapshot of the current blockchain state, which can be reverted to later using the `revertAsync` method. The `resetAsync` method resets the blockchain to its initial state. The `increaseTimeAsync` method increases the time on the blockchain by a specified duration, which can be useful for testing time-dependent smart contracts. The `waitBlocksAsync` method waits for a specified number of blocks to be mined before returning.

Overall, the `Blockchain` class provides a convenient interface for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain in a testing or development environment. Here is an example of how it can be used:

```
import { providers } from 'ethers'
import { Blockchain } from 'zoo'

const provider = new providers.JsonRpcProvider()
const blockchain = new Blockchain(provider)

// Save a snapshot of the current blockchain state
await blockchain.saveSnapshotAsync()

// Increase the time on the blockchain by 1 hour
await blockchain.increaseTimeAsync(3600)

// Wait for 10 blocks to be mined
await blockchain.waitBlocksAsync(10)

// Revert to the previously saved snapshot
await blockchain.revertAsync()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   This code defines a class called `Blockchain` that provides methods for interacting with an Ethereum blockchain through a JSON-RPC provider.

2. What is the significance of the `evm_snapshot` and `evm_revert` methods?
   The `evm_snapshot` method saves a snapshot of the current state of the blockchain, while the `evm_revert` method reverts the blockchain to a previously saved snapshot. These methods are useful for testing and development purposes.

3. What is the purpose of the `increaseTimeAsync` and `waitBlocksAsync` methods?
   The `increaseTimeAsync` method increases the timestamp of the blockchain by a specified duration, while the `waitBlocksAsync` method mines a specified number of blocks on the blockchain. These methods are useful for testing time-dependent smart contracts.
