This code is responsible for watching changes in the `./src` and `./test` directories of a project and running tests whenever a change is detected. The `node-watch` library is used to monitor the directories for changes, and the `child_process` module is used to execute the `yarn test` command whenever a change is detected.

The `run` function is defined to execute the `yarn test` command and log the output to the console. When a change is detected in either the `./src` or `./test` directories, the `run` function is called to execute the tests. The `watch` function is used to monitor the directories for changes and call the `run` function whenever a change is detected.

This code is useful in a larger project where automated testing is important. By monitoring the directories for changes and automatically running tests, developers can quickly identify any issues that arise as a result of code changes. This can help to catch bugs early in the development process and ensure that the project remains stable and functional.

Example usage:

```
// Install dependencies
yarn install

// Start watching for changes and running tests
node index.js
```
