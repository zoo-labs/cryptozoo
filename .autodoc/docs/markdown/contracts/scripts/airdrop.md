The code is a script that performs an airdrop of a token called ZOO to a list of addresses. The script reads a CSV file called `holders.csv` that contains a list of addresses and the amount of ZOO tokens to be airdropped to each address. The CSV file is parsed using the `csv-parse` library, and the resulting records are processed in chunks of 420 addresses at a time. 

The script uses the `ethers` library to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the `ZOO` contract, which is deployed on the local blockchain. The `ZOO` contract is loaded using the `getContractAt` method, and the `airdrop` method of the contract is called for each chunk of addresses. The `airdrop` method takes two arrays as arguments: an array of addresses and an array of amounts. The script constructs these arrays from the parsed CSV records, filtering out any records with a zero amount. 

The `chunks` function is a helper function that splits an array into chunks of a given size. It is used to split the list of addresses into manageable chunks that can be processed by the `airdrop` method. 

The script logs the progress of the airdrop to the console, indicating which chunk is being processed and how many addresses have been processed so far. If an error occurs during the airdrop, the script logs an error message to the console and continues with the next chunk. 

The script starts by throwing an error, which prevents it from executing the airdrop. This is likely a safety measure to prevent accidental execution of the script. To execute the script, the error should be commented out or removed. 

To use this script in the larger project, the `holders.csv` file should be prepared with the list of addresses and amounts to be airdropped. The script should be executed using the `hardhat` command-line tool, which provides a local blockchain environment for testing and development. The `ZOO` contract should be deployed on the local blockchain before executing the script. The script can be modified to use a different contract or a different token by changing the contract address and the method name in the `getContractAt` method.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `chunks` function?
- The `chunks` function takes an array and a size as input and returns an array of arrays, where each sub-array has a maximum length of `size`.

2. What is the purpose of the `holders.csv` file?
- The `holders.csv` file contains a list of addresses and amounts that will be used for an airdrop.

3. Why is there a `throw new Error('Air drop done')` statement at the beginning of the `main` function?
- The `throw new Error('Air drop done')` statement is used to intentionally throw an error and stop the program from executing. This is likely used for testing purposes to ensure that the airdrop function is not accidentally executed.
