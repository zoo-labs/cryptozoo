The code in this file is responsible for deploying the WETH (Wrapped Ether) contract using the Deploy function from the @zoolabs/contracts/utils/deploy module. 

The Deploy function takes three arguments: the name of the contract to be deployed (in this case, 'WETH'), an empty object for any additional configuration options, and an async function that handles the deployment process. 

Within the async function, the code uses the provided dependencies (hre, deploy, deployments, and deps) to execute the deployment. The exact details of the deployment process are not specified in this file, but it is likely that the Deploy function handles the necessary steps to compile and deploy the contract to the appropriate network. 

This code is likely part of a larger project that involves deploying and interacting with smart contracts related to a zoo-themed application. The WETH contract is a commonly used ERC-20 token that represents Ether on the Ethereum network, and it may be used within the larger project for various purposes such as trading or liquidity provision. 

Here is an example of how this code might be used in a larger project:

```
import WETH from './02_weth.ts'
import { ethers } from 'ethers'

// Deploy the WETH contract
const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider()
const signer = provider.getSigner()
const weth = await WETH({ hre: { ethers, provider, signer } })

// Use the WETH contract
const balance = await weth.balanceOf('0x123...')
console.log(`My WETH balance is ${balance}`)
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code file and what does it do?
   - This code file is named `02_weth.ts` and it appears to be exporting a function called `Deploy` from a module located at `@zoolabs/contracts/utils/deploy`. The function is being passed three arguments and is likely responsible for deploying something related to WETH.
2. What is the significance of the empty object being passed as the second argument to the `Deploy` function?
   - It's unclear without more context, but the empty object being passed as the second argument to the `Deploy` function may be used to provide additional configuration options or parameters for the deployment process.
3. What is the purpose of the `async` keyword before the function passed as the third argument to the `Deploy` function?
   - The `async` keyword indicates that the function passed as the third argument to the `Deploy` function is an asynchronous function, which means it can use the `await` keyword to wait for promises to resolve before continuing execution. This may be important for ensuring that the deployment process completes successfully.
