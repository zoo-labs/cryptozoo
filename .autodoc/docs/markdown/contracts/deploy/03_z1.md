The code in this file is responsible for deploying a contract called 'Z1' using the Deploy function from the '@zoolabs/contracts/utils/deploy' library. The Deploy function takes in four parameters: the name of the contract to be deployed, an object containing any additional deployment options, an asynchronous function that handles the deployment process, and an optional dependencies object.

In this case, the name of the contract is 'Z1' and no additional deployment options are specified. The asynchronous function passed to Deploy is an arrow function that takes in an object with four properties: hre, deploy, deployments, and deps. These properties are provided by the Deploy function and can be used to interact with the deployment process.

The 'await deploy()' statement within the arrow function is responsible for actually deploying the contract. The Deploy function handles the deployment process and returns a Promise that resolves to the deployed contract instance.

This code can be used as a starting point for deploying the 'Z1' contract in a larger project. For example, it could be imported into a script that deploys multiple contracts and used to deploy the 'Z1' contract alongside other contracts. Here is an example of how this code could be used in a larger deployment script:

```
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import DeployZ1 from './03_z1.ts';

async function deployContracts() {
  const provider = new ethers.providers.JsonRpcProvider();
  const signer = provider.getSigner();

  const deployedZ1 = await DeployZ1('Z1', {}, async ({ hre, deploy, deployments, deps }) => {
    await deploy();
  });

  console.log('Z1 deployed at:', deployedZ1.address);
}

deployContracts();
```

In this example, the DeployZ1 function is imported from the '03_z1.ts' file and used to deploy the 'Z1' contract. The deployed contract instance is then logged to the console.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Deploy` function and where is it defined?
   - The `Deploy` function is imported from the `@zoolabs/contracts/utils/deploy` module and its purpose is not clear from this code snippet alone. It is likely used for deploying contracts, but more information is needed to confirm.
2. What is the significance of the `Z1` argument passed to the `Deploy` function?
   - The `Z1` argument is likely a name or identifier for the contract being deployed, but its specific meaning and usage is not clear from this code snippet alone.
3. What is the purpose of the `async` function passed as the second argument to the `Deploy` function?
   - The `async` function likely contains the deployment logic for the contract being deployed, but more information is needed to confirm. It is also unclear what the `hre`, `deploy`, `deployments`, and `deps` arguments represent and how they are used within the function.
