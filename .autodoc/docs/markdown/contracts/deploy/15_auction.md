The `15_auction.ts` file is a TypeScript module that exports a single default function called `func`. This function is a `DeployFunction` that is used to deploy an `Auction` contract to the blockchain. The `Auction` contract is not defined in this file, but it is assumed to be defined elsewhere in the project.

The `func` function takes a single argument, `hre`, which is an instance of the `HardhatRuntimeEnvironment` class. This class provides access to various tools and utilities that are used to interact with the blockchain, such as the `deployments` object, which is used to deploy contracts, and the `ethers` object, which is used to interact with contracts that have already been deployed.

The `func` function first retrieves the `deployer` account from the `getNamedAccounts` function, which is provided by the `hardhat-deploy` plugin. This account is used as the `from` address when deploying the `Auction` contract.

The `deploy` function is then called to deploy the `Auction` contract. The `args` parameter is an empty array, which means that the `Auction` contract is deployed with no constructor arguments. The `log` parameter is set to `true`, which means that deployment progress will be logged to the console.

After the `Auction` contract has been deployed, the `tokenAddress` and `mediaAddress` variables are set to the addresses of the `ZOO` and `Media` contracts, respectively. These contracts are assumed to have already been deployed elsewhere in the project.

Finally, the `configure` function is called on the `auction` object to configure the `Auction` contract with the addresses of the `Media` and `ZOO` contracts. This function is assumed to be defined in the `Auction` contract.

The `func` function returns a boolean value indicating whether the deployment was successful. This value is determined by the `live` property of the `network` object, which is provided by the `HardhatRuntimeEnvironment` class.

Overall, this code is used to deploy an `Auction` contract to the blockchain and configure it with the addresses of the `Media` and `ZOO` contracts. This function is likely to be called as part of a larger deployment script that deploys all of the contracts needed for the project. An example of how this function might be used in a deployment script is shown below:

```typescript
import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from 'hardhat/types'
import { DeployFunction } from 'hardhat-deploy/types'
import auctionFunc from './15_auction'

const deployFunc: DeployFunction = async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
  await auctionFunc(hre)
  // deploy other contracts here
}

deployFunc.tags = ['deploy']
export default deployFunc
``` 

In this example, the `auctionFunc` function is called as part of a larger `deployFunc` function that deploys all of the contracts needed for the project. The `tags` property is set to `['deploy']`, which means that this function can be called using the `npx hardhat deploy --tags deploy` command.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a deployment script for an auction contract in the zoo project.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code imports `HardhatRuntimeEnvironment` and `DeployFunction` from `hardhat` and `hardhat-deploy` respectively. It also depends on the `ZOO` and `Media` contracts.

3. What does the `configure` function do?
   - The `configure` function is called on the `Auction` contract instance and is used to set the `mediaAddress` and `tokenAddress` variables.
