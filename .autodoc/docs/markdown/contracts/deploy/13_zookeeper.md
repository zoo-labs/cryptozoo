This code is a deployment script for the Zoo project. It deploys a contract called ZooKeeper and sets up various configurations for other contracts in the project. 

The script first imports the necessary modules from Hardhat and hardhat-deploy. It then defines a DeployFunction that takes in a HardhatRuntimeEnvironment object. 

Inside the function, it extracts various objects from the HardhatRuntimeEnvironment object, such as deployments, ethers, getNamedAccounts, and network. It also gets the deployer's wallet using ethers.getSigners() and the deployer's address using getNamedAccounts(). 

The script then deploys the ZooKeeper contract using the deploy() function from deployments. It passes in the deployer's address as the "from" parameter and an empty array as the "args" parameter. 

After deploying the ZooKeeper contract, the script sets up various configurations for other contracts in the project. It gets the addresses of various contracts using ethers.getContract() and ethers.getContractAt(). It then calls various functions on these contracts to configure them. 

For example, it calls market.connect(deployerWallet).configure(media.address) to configure the Market contract with the Media contract's address. It also calls media.connect(deployerWallet).configure(keeper.address, market.address) to configure the Media contract with the ZooKeeper and Market contract addresses. 

Finally, the script mints 1000000000000 ZOO tokens to the ZooKeeper contract for yield. 

Overall, this script is an important part of the Zoo project's deployment process. It deploys the ZooKeeper contract and sets up various configurations for other contracts in the project. Developers can use this script to deploy the Zoo project to various networks. 

Example usage:

```
npx hardhat deploy --network rinkeby
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
   - This code is a deployment script for a contract called `ZooKeeper` and it also configures other contracts and mints tokens.

2. What dependencies does this code have?
   - This code has dependencies on `Bridge`, `Media`, `ZOO`, `BNB`, `Market`, `UniswapV2Factory`, and `UniswapV2Pair` contracts.

3. What is the significance of the `if (hre.network.name == 'mainnet') return` statement?
   - This statement causes the function to return early if the network name is `mainnet`, which means that the following code will only be executed on non-mainnet networks.
