The `14_drop.ts` file is a TypeScript module that exports a default function that deploys a contract called `Drop`. The `Deploy` function is imported from `@zoolabs/contracts/utils/deploy`. This function takes three arguments: a string representing the name of the contract to be deployed, an object representing the constructor arguments for the contract, and an async callback function that is executed after the contract is deployed. 

The callback function takes several parameters: `hre`, `ethers`, `deploy`, `deployments`, and `deps`. `hre` is an object representing the Hardhat Runtime Environment, which is a development environment for Ethereum smart contracts. `ethers` is a library for interacting with Ethereum contracts and wallets. `deploy` is a function that can be used to deploy additional contracts. `deployments` is an object that provides information about previously deployed contracts. `deps` is an object that provides access to other contracts that have been deployed.

The `deploy` function is called with an array of constructor arguments for the `Drop` contract. The resulting transaction object is stored in the `tx` variable. 

If the network name is not `mainnet`, the function continues by getting a contract instance of `Drop` at the address specified in the `tx` object. It also gets a contract instance of `ZooKeeper` using the `ethers.getContract` function. Finally, it calls the `configureGame` function with the `keeper` and `drop` instances as arguments. 

The purpose of this code is to deploy and configure the `Drop` contract for the `zoo` project. The `configureGame` function sets the initial state for the `Gen 0` drop, which is a special type of NFT that represents the first generation of animals in the zoo. This code is likely part of a larger deployment script that deploys and configures all the contracts needed for the `zoo` project. 

Example usage:

```
import deployDrop from './14_drop'

deployDrop()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `Deploy` function being imported from `@zoolabs/contracts/utils/deploy`?
   
   The `Deploy` function is likely used to deploy the `Drop` contract with the specified parameters and return the transaction hash.

2. What is the `configureGame` function and what does it do?
   
   The `configureGame` function is a utility function that executes a series of transactions to set the initial state for the `Gen 0` drop. It is mentioned that this function may not work during Testnet or Mainnet deployment and a standalone `yarn deploy:drop` command should be used instead.

3. Why is there a conditional statement checking for the network name being 'mainnet'?
   
   The conditional statement is likely used to skip the rest of the code block if the network being deployed to is the mainnet. This could be because the `configureGame` function may not work as expected on the mainnet and requires a different deployment process.
