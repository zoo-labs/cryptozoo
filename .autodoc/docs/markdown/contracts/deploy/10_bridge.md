The code in this file is responsible for deploying and configuring a contract called "Bridge" in the larger zoo project. The Bridge contract is dependent on another contract called "DAO", which is specified in the code as a dependency. 

The code first imports the Deploy function from a utility module in the zoo project. It then exports a default function that calls the Deploy function with the name "Bridge" and an object containing the dependencies array and an async function. 

The async function takes in several parameters, including ethers (a library for interacting with Ethereum), deploy (a function for deploying contracts), deployments (a library for managing contract deployments), deps (an object containing the dependencies specified in the first argument of the Deploy function), and hre (a Hardhat Runtime Environment object). 

Within the async function, the code retrieves the DAO contract address from the deps object and deploys the Bridge contract with the DAO address and a value of 25. It then uses the deployments library to set up a fixture for the "ZOO" contract and retrieves the contract's address and ABI. Finally, it uses ethers to get an instance of the ZOO contract and calls its configure function with the address of the deployed Bridge contract. 

Overall, this code serves as a crucial step in setting up the larger zoo project by deploying and configuring the Bridge contract, which is necessary for the project's functionality. 

Example usage:

```
import Bridge from './10_bridge.ts'

Bridge()
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
   - This code deploys a contract called "Bridge" and configures it with the address of a DAO contract. It also interacts with a contract called "ZOO" using its ABI and address.
2. What are the dependencies of the "Bridge" contract?
   - The "Bridge" contract has a dependency on the "DAO" contract.
3. What is the significance of the number 25 passed as the second argument to the deploy function?
   - It is unclear from this code what the significance of the number 25 is. It may be a parameter specific to the "Bridge" contract or a value used in the deployment process. Further context is needed to determine its purpose.
