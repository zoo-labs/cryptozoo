The code defines an interface called `IRewarder` which is used to interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. The interface contains two functions: `onTokensReward` and `pendingTokens`. 

The `onTokensReward` function is used to reward users with tokens for participating in a liquidity pool. It takes in five parameters: `pid`, `user`, `recipient`, `tokenAmount`, and `newLpAmount`. `pid` is an identifier for the liquidity pool, `user` is the address of the user who is being rewarded, `recipient` is the address where the tokens will be sent, `tokenAmount` is the amount of tokens to be rewarded, and `newLpAmount` is the new amount of liquidity pool tokens that the user will receive after being rewarded. The function returns a `ContractTransaction` object which can be used to track the status of the transaction on the blockchain.

The `pendingTokens` function is used to get the pending tokens for a user in a liquidity pool. It takes in three parameters: `pid`, `user`, and `tokenAmount`. `pid` is an identifier for the liquidity pool, `user` is the address of the user whose pending tokens are being queried, and `tokenAmount` is the amount of tokens that the user has in the liquidity pool. The function returns an array of addresses and an array of `BigNumber` objects representing the pending tokens for the user.

This interface can be used by other smart contracts or applications to interact with the liquidity pool contract and reward users for participating in the pool. For example, a decentralized exchange application could use this interface to reward users for providing liquidity to a trading pair. 

Here is an example of how the `onTokensReward` function could be used in a smart contract:

```
import { IRewarder } from "./IRewarder";

const rewarderAddress = "0x123..."; // address of the liquidity pool contract
const rewarder = IRewarder.attach(rewarderAddress);

async function rewardUser(pid: number, user: string, recipient: string, tokenAmount: number, newLpAmount: number) {
  const tx = await rewarder.onTokensReward(pid, user, recipient, tokenAmount, newLpAmount);
  await tx.wait(); // wait for the transaction to be mined
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines an interface called `IRewarder` which specifies two functions related to token rewards. It is likely part of a larger smart contract system that involves incentivizing users to participate in some way.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several modules from the `ethers` and `@ethersproject` packages, which are used for interacting with Ethereum and its smart contracts.

3. What are the parameters and return values of the `onTokensReward` and `pendingTokens` functions?
- The `onTokensReward` function takes in five parameters: `pid` (a number), `user` and `recipient` (both Ethereum addresses), `tokenAmount` (a number), and `newLpAmount` (another number). It returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `ContractTransaction`.
- The `pendingTokens` function takes in three parameters: `pid` (a number), `user` (an Ethereum address), and `tokenAmount` (a number). It returns a `Promise` that resolves to an array of two arrays, the first containing Ethereum addresses and the second containing numbers.
