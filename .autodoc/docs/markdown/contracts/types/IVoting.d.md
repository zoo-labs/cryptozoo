The code defines an interface called `IVoting` that extends the `BaseContract` class. The interface contains four functions and two events. The `IVoting` interface is used to interact with a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain that handles voting and blocking of addresses.

The `IVoting` interface has four functions:
- `blockAddress`: This function blocks an address from voting by setting the `freeze` parameter to `true`. It takes two parameters: `target`, which is the address to be blocked, and `freeze`, which is a boolean value that determines whether the address should be blocked or unblocked. This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `ContractTransaction` object.
- `changeWithdrawAddress`: This function changes the address that can withdraw funds from the contract. It takes one parameter: `_newWithdrawAddress`, which is the new address that can withdraw funds. This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `ContractTransaction` object.
- `isBlocked`: This function checks whether an address is blocked from voting. It takes one parameter: `_addr`, which is the address to check. This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a boolean value.
- `voteProposal`: This function allows an address to vote on a proposal. It takes two parameters: `proposal`, which is the proposal to vote on, and `choice`, which is a boolean value that determines whether to vote for or against the proposal. This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `ContractTransaction` object.

The `IVoting` interface also has two events:
- `addedProposal`: This event is emitted when a new proposal is added to the contract. It contains two parameters: `newProposals`, which is the new proposal that was added, and `timestamp`, which is the timestamp of when the proposal was added.
- `votedProposal`: This event is emitted when an address votes on a proposal. It contains two parameters: `proposal`, which is the proposal that was voted on, and `choice`, which is a boolean value that represents whether the address voted for or against the proposal.

This interface can be used by other parts of the `zoo` project to interact with the smart contract that handles voting and blocking of addresses. For example, a frontend component of the project could use the `voteProposal` function to allow users to vote on proposals. Here is an example of how the `voteProposal` function could be used:

```
const votingContract = new IVoting(address);
const proposal = "Increase funding for animal care";
const choice = true; // vote for the proposal
const tx = await votingContract.voteProposal(proposal, choice);
await tx.wait(); // wait for the transaction to be mined
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this contract and what does it do?
- This contract is an interface for a voting system. It has functions for blocking addresses, changing withdrawal addresses, checking if an address is blocked, and voting on proposals.

2. What libraries and dependencies does this code use?
- This code imports several libraries and dependencies including ethers, @ethersproject/bytes, and @ethersproject/providers.

3. What events can be emitted by this contract and what information do they contain?
- This contract can emit two events: "addedProposal" and "votedProposal". The "addedProposal" event contains a string representing the new proposal and a number representing the timestamp. The "votedProposal" event contains a string representing the proposal and a boolean representing the choice made by the voter.
