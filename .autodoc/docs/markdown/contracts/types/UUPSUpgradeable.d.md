The `UUPSUpgradeable` class is a contract that allows for upgradability of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. It is imported from the `common` module and extends the `BaseContract` class. 

The contract has three functions: `proxiableUUID`, `upgradeTo`, and `upgradeToAndCall`. 

The `proxiableUUID` function returns a unique identifier for the contract. 

The `upgradeTo` function upgrades the contract to a new implementation. It takes in a `newImplementation` parameter, which is the address of the new implementation contract. This function can only be called by the contract's admin. 

The `upgradeToAndCall` function upgrades the contract to a new implementation and calls a function on the new implementation. It takes in two parameters: `newImplementation`, which is the address of the new implementation contract, and `data`, which is the data to be passed to the function being called on the new implementation. This function can only be called by the contract's admin. 

The contract also has several events: `AdminChanged`, `BeaconUpgraded`, `Initialized`, and `Upgraded`. These events are emitted when the admin is changed, the beacon is upgraded, the contract is initialized, and the contract is upgraded, respectively. 

This contract can be used in the larger project to allow for upgradability of smart contracts. By using this contract, developers can upgrade their smart contracts without having to deploy a new contract and migrate all the data to the new contract. This can save time and money, as well as reduce the risk of errors during the migration process. 

Example usage of the `upgradeTo` function:

```
const newImplementation = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890";
const overrides = { from: admin };
const tx = await uupsContract.upgradeTo(newImplementation, overrides);
await tx.wait();
```

In this example, the `upgradeTo` function is called on the `uupsContract` instance to upgrade the contract to a new implementation with the address `0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890`. The `overrides` parameter is an object that specifies the `from` address, which is the admin of the contract. The function returns a `ContractTransaction` object, which is then waited on to ensure that the transaction is mined.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what does it do?
- This code defines an interface and a class called `UUPSUpgradeable` which provides functions for upgrading a contract to a new implementation and querying the UUID of the contract. It also defines several events related to contract upgrades.

2. What external dependencies does this code have?
- This code imports several modules from the `ethers` and `@ethersproject` packages, which provide functionality for interacting with Ethereum contracts and networks.

3. What are the different functions provided by the `UUPSUpgradeable` class and what do they do?
- The `UUPSUpgradeable` class provides three functions: `proxiableUUID`, which returns the UUID of the contract; `upgradeTo`, which upgrades the contract to a new implementation; and `upgradeToAndCall`, which upgrades the contract to a new implementation and calls a function on the new implementation. These functions can be called with different overrides and options depending on the use case.
