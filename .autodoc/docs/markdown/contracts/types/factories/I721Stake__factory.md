This code defines the interface and factory for the I721Stake contract, which is used for staking ERC721 tokens. The contract includes functions for freezing and unfreezing NFTs, checking if a staker is frozen, receiving ERC1155 tokens, and staking and unstaking ERC721 tokens. 

The `I721Stake` contract is defined in another file and this file imports the contract and defines its interface and factory. The interface defines the functions and events that can be called on the contract, while the factory is used to create instances of the contract.

The `freezeNft` function is used to freeze an NFT, preventing it from being staked. The `isFrozenNft` function checks if an NFT is frozen. The `isFrozenStaker` function checks if a staker is frozen. The `onERC1155Received` function is called when the contract receives an ERC1155 token. The `rewardAmount` function returns the reward amount for staking a particular ERC721 token. The `stake` function is used to stake an ERC721 token, while the `unstake` function is used to unstake an ERC721 token. The `updateRewardCoin` function is used to update the reward coin for staking.

This code is used in the larger project to define the interface and factory for the `I721Stake` contract, which can be used to stake ERC721 tokens. Other parts of the project can use this interface and factory to interact with the `I721Stake` contract. For example, a user interface could use the `stake` and `unstake` functions to allow users to stake and unstake their ERC721 tokens.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines a smart contract interface for staking ERC721 tokens and provides functions for freezing and unfreezing NFTs and stakers, as well as updating the reward coin.

2. What events are emitted by this contract and what information do they provide?
- Two events are emitted: "NewStake" and "unStaked". Both events provide the address of the staker, the address of the NFT contract, and the ID of the staked token.

3. What are the inputs and outputs of the "rewardAmount" function?
- The "rewardAmount" function takes in the address of an NFT contract and the ID of a staked token, and returns an array of uint256 values representing the reward amounts for each reward coin.
