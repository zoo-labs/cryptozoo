This code is a configuration file for the zoo project. It contains two key-value pairs, "_format" and "buildInfo". The "_format" key specifies the format of the configuration file, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key specifies the location of the build information file for the project, which is located at "../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json".

The purpose of this configuration file is to provide important information about the project, such as the format of the configuration file and the location of the build information file. This information can be used by other parts of the project to ensure that the project is built and configured correctly.

For example, if another part of the project needs to access the build information file, it can use the location specified in this configuration file to find it. Similarly, if another part of the project needs to read or modify the configuration file, it can use the format specified in this configuration file to ensure that it is reading or modifying the file correctly.

Overall, this configuration file plays an important role in ensuring that the zoo project is built and configured correctly. While it may seem simple, it provides essential information that is used throughout the project.
