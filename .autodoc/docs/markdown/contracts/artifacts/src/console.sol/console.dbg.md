This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build date.

This code is important for tracking the version and build information of the project. It can be used to ensure that all team members are working with the same version of the code, and to troubleshoot issues that may arise during development or deployment. 

For example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the build information can be used to identify which version of the code introduced the bug and when it was introduced. This can help developers pinpoint the cause of the issue and develop a fix more quickly.

To access the build information in this code, it can be parsed as a JSON object in a programming language such as Python. For example:

```python
import json

with open('zoo/build_info.json') as f:
    build_info = json.load(f)

print(build_info['_format']) # prints "hh-sol-dbg-1"
print(build_info['buildInfo']) # prints "../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json"
```

Overall, this code serves an important role in the larger project by providing version and build information that can be used for debugging and troubleshooting.
