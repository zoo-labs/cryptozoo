This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build date.

This code is important for tracking the version and build information of the project. It can be used to ensure that the correct version of the project is being used, and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development or deployment. 

For example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the build information can be used to identify which version of the project the bug was introduced in, and to track down the specific commit that caused the issue. 

In addition, the build information can be used to ensure that all developers are working with the same version of the project. By including the build information in the project repository, developers can easily check which version they are working with and ensure that they are all on the same page.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the larger project, providing valuable information about the build and version of the project.
