This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key specifies the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key specifies the location of the build information file, which is located at "../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json".

This code is important for tracking the build of the project and ensuring that the correct version is being used. It may be used in the larger project by other parts of the code that need to access the build information, such as for debugging or troubleshooting purposes.

For example, if a bug is found in the project, the developer may need to check the build information to see if the bug is related to a specific build version. They can access the build information using this code and then compare it to the version of the code that is currently being used.

Overall, this code serves as a small but important piece of the larger project, providing crucial information about the build that can be used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.
