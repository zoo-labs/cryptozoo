This code is a JSON file that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the file, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file located at "../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json". 

The purpose of this code is to provide information about the build of the project, which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. The buildInfo file likely contains information such as the version number, build date, and any relevant build parameters. 

In the larger project, this code may be used by developers and testers to identify the build of the project they are working with. For example, if a bug is reported, the buildInfo file can be checked to see if the bug is present in a specific build. Additionally, the buildInfo file can be used to ensure that all team members are working with the same build of the project. 

Here is an example of how this code may be used in a larger project:

```python
import json

with open('zoo/build.json') as f:
    build_info = json.load(f)

print(f"Build version: {build_info['version']}")
print(f"Build date: {build_info['date']}")
```

This code reads the buildInfo file located in the zoo directory and prints out the version number and build date. This information can be used to ensure that all team members are working with the same build of the project and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
