This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build date.

This code is important for tracking the version and build information of the project. It can be used to ensure that the correct version of the project is being used, and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development or deployment. 

For example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the build information can be used to identify which version of the project the bug was introduced in, and to track down the specific commit that caused the issue. 

In addition, the build information can be used to ensure that all developers are working with the same version of the project, and to ensure that the correct version is deployed to production. 

Overall, this code serves as a key piece of metadata for the project, providing important information about the build and version of the code.
