This code is a JSON file that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the file, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file located at "../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json". 

The purpose of this code is to provide information about the build of the project. This information can be used to track changes and updates to the project, as well as to ensure that all components of the project are up-to-date and compatible with each other. 

For example, if a developer wants to update a component of the project, they can check the buildInfo file to see if the update is compatible with the current build. If it is not, they may need to update other components of the project to ensure compatibility. 

Overall, this code serves as a reference point for the build of the project and can be used to ensure that all components are working together properly.
