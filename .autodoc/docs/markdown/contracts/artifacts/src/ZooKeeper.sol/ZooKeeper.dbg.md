The code above is a JSON file that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the file, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to the location of the build information file, which is located at "../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json".

This file is important for the project because it provides information about the build, such as the version number, build date, and other relevant information. This information can be used to troubleshoot issues that may arise during the development process, as well as to keep track of changes made to the project over time.

For example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the build information file can be used to determine which version of the project the bug was introduced in, and which version it was fixed in. This can help developers to quickly identify the cause of the bug and implement a fix.

Overall, this file is a small but important part of the larger project, as it provides valuable information about the build that can be used to improve the development process and ensure the quality of the final product.
