The code provided is a JSON object that describes the interface of a smart contract called `IVoting`. The `IVoting` contract is likely part of a larger project that involves voting on proposals. The interface specifies the functions and events that can be called or emitted by the contract.

The `IVoting` contract has six functions and two events. The `blockAddress` function takes an address and a boolean value as input and blocks or unblocks the address from voting. The `changeWithdrawAddress` function takes an address as input and changes the address where funds can be withdrawn. The `isBlocked` function takes an address as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the address is blocked from voting. The `voteProposal` function takes a proposal and a boolean value as input and allows the caller to vote on the proposal.

The two events are `addedProposal` and `votedProposal`. The `addedProposal` event is emitted when a new proposal is added to the voting system. The event includes the name of the proposal and a timestamp. The `votedProposal` event is emitted when a proposal is voted on. The event includes the name of the proposal and the choice made by the voter.

The JSON object also includes bytecode and link references, which are used to deploy and link the contract on the blockchain.

Overall, this code provides a high-level interface for a voting system that allows users to add proposals, vote on proposals, and block or unblock addresses from voting. The interface can be used by other contracts or applications to interact with the `IVoting` contract on the blockchain. For example, a web application could use the `voteProposal` function to allow users to vote on proposals, and display the results using the `votedProposal` event.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this contract and what does it do?
   - The contract is called `IVoting` and it contains functions for blocking addresses, changing withdrawal addresses, and voting on proposals. It also emits events for adding proposals and voting on proposals.
   
2. What is the format of the ABI and what does it contain?
   - The ABI is an array of objects, each representing a function or event in the contract. Each object contains information such as the function/event name, input/output types, and whether it is payable or not.
   
3. What is the significance of the bytecode and deployedBytecode fields being empty?
   - The bytecode and deployedBytecode fields being empty means that the contract has not been compiled or deployed yet. These fields would contain the compiled bytecode of the contract and the bytecode of the deployed contract, respectively, if the contract had been compiled and deployed.
