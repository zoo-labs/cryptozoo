This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build date.

This code is important for tracking the version and build of the project. It can be used to ensure that all developers are working with the same version of the code, and to identify any issues that may arise from changes in the build. The buildInfo file can also be used to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during the build process.

Here is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:

```python
import json

with open('zoo/build.json', 'r') as f:
    build_info = json.load(f)

print(f"Build format: {build_info['_format']}")
print(f"Commit hash: {build_info['commitHash']}")
print(f"Build date: {build_info['buildDate']}")
```

This code reads the buildInfo file and prints out the format, commit hash, and build date. This information can be used to ensure that all developers are working with the same version of the code, and to identify any issues that may arise from changes in the build.
