This code defines an interface called `IRewarder` which specifies two functions: `onTokensReward` and `pendingTokens`. The purpose of this interface is to provide a standard way for different contracts to interact with a reward system. 

The `onTokensReward` function takes in five parameters: `pid`, `user`, `recipient`, `tokenAmount`, and `newLpAmount`. The `pid` parameter is an unsigned integer that represents the pool ID of the reward system. The `user` parameter is an Ethereum address that represents the user who is receiving the reward. The `recipient` parameter is also an Ethereum address that represents the recipient of the reward. The `tokenAmount` parameter is an unsigned integer that represents the amount of tokens being rewarded. The `newLpAmount` parameter is also an unsigned integer that represents the new amount of liquidity pool tokens. This function does not return anything and is marked as `nonpayable`, which means it cannot receive Ether as payment.

The `pendingTokens` function takes in three parameters: `pid`, `user`, and `tokenAmount`. The `pid` and `user` parameters are the same as in the `onTokensReward` function. The `tokenAmount` parameter is an unsigned integer that represents the amount of tokens being rewarded. This function returns two values: an array of `IERC20` contracts and an array of unsigned integers. The `IERC20` contract array represents the tokens that are pending as rewards, and the unsigned integer array represents the amount of each token that is pending. This function is marked as `view`, which means it does not modify the state of the contract and does not require any gas to execute.

Overall, this interface provides a way for different contracts to interact with a reward system in a standardized way. For example, a liquidity pool contract could implement this interface to receive rewards from a reward system contract that also implements this interface. By implementing this interface, the reward system contract can interact with the liquidity pool contract without needing to know the specific details of the contract's implementation.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall zoo project?
- This code defines an interface called IRewarder with two functions related to token rewards. It likely serves as a way for other contracts in the zoo project to interact with a rewards system.

2. What are the expected inputs and outputs for the `onTokensReward` and `pendingTokens` functions?
- `onTokensReward` takes in five inputs: a pool ID, a user address, a recipient address, a token amount, and a new LP amount. It has no outputs. `pendingTokens` takes in three inputs: a pool ID, a user address, and a token amount. It outputs two arrays, one of ERC20 token addresses and one of corresponding token amounts.

3. What is the significance of the "bytecode" and "deployedBytecode" fields?
- The "bytecode" field contains the compiled bytecode of the contract, while the "deployedBytecode" field contains the bytecode of the contract after it has been deployed to the blockchain. These fields are useful for verifying that the deployed contract matches the expected bytecode.
