The code above is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which in this case is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build date.

This code is important for tracking the version and build information of the project. It can be used to ensure that the correct version of the project is being used, and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development or deployment.

For example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the build information can be used to determine which version of the project the bug was introduced in, and to track down the specific commit that caused the issue. This can save a significant amount of time and effort in debugging and fixing the problem.

In addition, the build information can be used to ensure that all developers and stakeholders are using the same version of the project. This can help to avoid compatibility issues and ensure that everyone is working with the same set of features and functionality.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the larger project, providing valuable information about the build and version of the project.
