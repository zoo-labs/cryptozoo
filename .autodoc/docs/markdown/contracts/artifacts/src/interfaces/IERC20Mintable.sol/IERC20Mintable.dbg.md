This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key specifies the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key specifies the location of the build information file, which is located at "../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json". 

The purpose of this code is to provide information about the build of the project. This information can be used to track changes and updates to the project, as well as to ensure that the project is running on the correct build. 

For example, if a developer wants to check which build of the project is currently running, they can access this JSON object and look at the value of the "buildInfo" key. They can then compare this value to the build information for the latest version of the project to see if any updates are needed. 

Overall, this code serves as a small but important piece of the larger project, providing crucial information about the build and helping to ensure that the project is running smoothly.
