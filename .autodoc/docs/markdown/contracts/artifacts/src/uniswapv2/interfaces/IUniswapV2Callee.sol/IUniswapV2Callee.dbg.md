This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build timestamp.

This code is important for tracking the version and build information of the project. It can be used to ensure that the correct version of the project is being used, and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development or deployment. 

For example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the buildInfo file can be checked to see which version of the project the bug was introduced in. This can help developers pinpoint the source of the bug and fix it more efficiently. 

In addition, this code can be used in conjunction with other tools, such as continuous integration and deployment systems, to automate the build and deployment process. By including this build information in the project, it becomes easier to track changes and ensure that the correct version of the project is being deployed to production.

Overall, this code serves as an important piece of metadata for the project, providing valuable information about the build and version of the project.
