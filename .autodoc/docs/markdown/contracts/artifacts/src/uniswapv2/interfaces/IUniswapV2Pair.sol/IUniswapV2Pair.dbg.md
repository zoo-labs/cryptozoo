This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key contains the path to the build information file, which is located at "../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json".

The purpose of this code is to provide information about the build of the project. This information can be used to track changes and updates to the project, as well as to ensure that the project is running on the correct version of the build. 

In the larger project, this code may be used in conjunction with other build-related code to automate the build process and ensure that the project is always up-to-date. For example, a build script may use this code to check the current build version and compare it to the latest version available. If a new version is available, the script may automatically download and install the latest build.

Here is an example of how this code may be used in a build script:

```
const buildInfo = require('./zoo/buildInfo.json');

if (buildInfo._format === 'hh-sol-dbg-1') {
  console.log('Current build version is hh-sol-dbg-1');
} else {
  console.log('Current build version is not hh-sol-dbg-1');
  // download and install latest build
}
```

Overall, this code plays an important role in the build process of the project and provides valuable information about the current build version.
