This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build date.

This code is important for tracking the version and build information of the project. It can be used to ensure that the correct version of the project is being used, and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development or deployment. 

For example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the buildInfo file can be checked to determine which version of the project the bug was introduced in. This can help developers pinpoint the cause of the bug and fix it more efficiently. 

In addition, the buildInfo file can be used to ensure that all developers are working with the same version of the project. This can help prevent compatibility issues and ensure that everyone is working with the most up-to-date code.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the larger project. It provides valuable information about the build and version of the project, which can be used to ensure that the project is running smoothly and efficiently.
