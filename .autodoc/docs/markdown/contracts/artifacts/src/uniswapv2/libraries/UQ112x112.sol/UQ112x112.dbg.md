This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key contains the path to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build date.

This code is important for tracking the version and build information of the project. It can be used to ensure that the correct version of the project is being used, and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development or deployment. 

For example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the buildInfo file can be used to determine which version of the project the bug was introduced in, and to track down the specific commit that caused the issue. This information can then be used to fix the bug and ensure that it does not reoccur in future builds.

Overall, this code serves as a crucial piece of metadata for the project, providing important information about the build and version history. It is a simple but essential component of any software development project.
