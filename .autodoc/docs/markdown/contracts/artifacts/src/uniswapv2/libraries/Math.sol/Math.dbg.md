This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build date.

This code is important for tracking the version and build of the project. It can be used to ensure that all team members are working with the same version of the code, and to troubleshoot issues that may arise during development or deployment. 

For example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the buildInfo file can be consulted to determine which version of the code introduced the bug. This information can then be used to roll back to a previous version of the code, or to identify the specific changes that caused the issue.

In addition, the buildInfo file can be used to track the progress of the project over time. By comparing the buildInfo files for different versions of the code, it is possible to see how the project has evolved and identify trends in the development process.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the larger project. It provides valuable information about the build of the project and can be used to ensure that the project is running smoothly and efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the "_format" field?
   - The "_format" field is likely used to indicate the format or version of the code or data contained within this file.

2. What does the "buildInfo" field refer to?
   - The "buildInfo" field likely refers to a JSON file containing information about the build process for this code, such as the version number or build date.

3. Why is the "buildInfo" field using a relative file path?
   - It's possible that the "buildInfo" field is using a relative file path to reference the JSON file containing build information because the file is located in a specific directory relative to the location of this code file.
