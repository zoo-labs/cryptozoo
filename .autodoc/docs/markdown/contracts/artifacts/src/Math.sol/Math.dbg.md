This code is a configuration file for the zoo project. It contains two key-value pairs: "_format" and "buildInfo". The "_format" key specifies the format of the configuration file, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key specifies the location of the build information file for the project, which is "../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json".

The purpose of this configuration file is to provide important information about the project to other parts of the system. The "_format" key ensures that the configuration file is in the correct format, which is important for the system to be able to read and use the information contained within it. The "buildInfo" key provides information about the build of the project, which can be used to track changes and ensure that the correct version of the project is being used.

This configuration file can be used in the larger project by other parts of the system that need access to the build information or need to ensure that the configuration file is in the correct format. For example, a build script may use the "buildInfo" key to determine which version of the project to build, or a testing script may use the "_format" key to ensure that the configuration file is in the correct format before running tests.

Overall, this configuration file plays an important role in the zoo project by providing key information about the project to other parts of the system.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the "_format" field in this code?
   - The "_format" field is likely used to specify the format or version of the code or data being used.

2. What is the significance of the "buildInfo" field and the file path specified?
   - The "buildInfo" field likely contains information about the build process for this code, and the file path specified likely points to a JSON file containing that information.

3. Is there any other relevant information or context needed to understand this code?
   - Without additional context, it is difficult to determine the full purpose and function of this code. It may be necessary to review other files or documentation related to the "zoo" project to fully understand its role.
