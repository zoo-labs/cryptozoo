This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, including the commit hash and build date.

This code is important for tracking the version and build of the project. It can be used to ensure that all developers are working with the same version of the code, and to troubleshoot issues that may arise during development or deployment. 

For example, if a bug is discovered in the project, the buildInfo file can be consulted to determine which version of the code introduced the bug. This information can then be used to roll back to a previous version of the code, or to identify the specific changes that caused the bug.

In addition, the buildInfo file can be used to generate release notes or other documentation about the project. By including information about the build date, commit hash, and other details, developers can easily track changes to the codebase over time.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the larger project. It provides valuable information about the build and version of the code, which can be used to ensure consistency and troubleshoot issues.
