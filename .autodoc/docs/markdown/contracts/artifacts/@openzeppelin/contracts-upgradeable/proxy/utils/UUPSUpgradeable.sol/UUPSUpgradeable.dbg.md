This code is a configuration file for the zoo project. It contains two key-value pairs: "_format" and "buildInfo". The "_format" key specifies the format of the configuration file, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key specifies the location of the build information file for the project, which is located at "../../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json".

The purpose of this configuration file is to provide important information about the project to other parts of the system. The "_format" key ensures that the configuration file is in the correct format, which is important for the system to be able to read and use the information contained within it. The "buildInfo" key provides information about the build of the project, which can be used to track changes and ensure that the correct version of the project is being used.

This configuration file can be used by other parts of the system to access the build information for the zoo project. For example, a deployment script may use the build information to ensure that the correct version of the project is being deployed. A testing script may use the build information to ensure that the correct version of the project is being tested. 

Here is an example of how this configuration file may be used in a deployment script:

```
import json

with open('zoo/config.json') as f:
    config = json.load(f)

build_info = config['buildInfo']
# use build_info to deploy the correct version of the project
```

In this example, the configuration file is loaded using the json module, and the build information is extracted from the "buildInfo" key. This build information can then be used to deploy the correct version of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the "_format" field in the code?
   - The "_format" field is likely used to specify a specific format or version of the code or data.
   
2. What is the significance of the "buildInfo" field?
   - The "buildInfo" field likely contains information about the build process for the code, such as the version or build number.
   
3. What is the meaning of the file path in the "buildInfo" field?
   - The file path in the "buildInfo" field likely points to a JSON file containing additional information about the build, such as the date and time of the build or the user who performed the build.
