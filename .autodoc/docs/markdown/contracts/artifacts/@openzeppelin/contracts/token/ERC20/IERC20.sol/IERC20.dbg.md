This code is a JSON file that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the file, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to the location of the build information file, which is located at "../../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json". 

The purpose of this code is to provide information about the build of the project. This information can be used to track changes and updates to the project, as well as to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development or deployment. 

For example, if a developer notices a bug in the project, they can refer to the build information file to see if any recent changes may have caused the issue. They can also use the build information to ensure that they are working with the most up-to-date version of the project. 

Overall, this code serves as an important component of the larger project by providing valuable information about the build and helping to ensure that the project is running smoothly.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the "_format" field?

2. What does the "buildInfo" field refer to?
   - The "buildInfo" field likely refers to a JSON file containing information about the build process for this code, such as the version number or build date.

3. Why is the buildInfo file located in a directory several levels above this file?
   - It's possible that the buildInfo file is located in a higher-level directory to ensure that it is easily accessible to other parts of the project, or to keep it separate from the code files themselves for organizational purposes.
