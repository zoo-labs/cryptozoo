This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key contains the path to the build information file, which is located at "../../../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json".

The purpose of this code is to provide information about the build of the project. This information can be used to track changes and updates to the project, as well as to troubleshoot any issues that may arise during development or deployment.

For example, if a developer encounters an error in the project, they can use the build information to determine which version of the project they are working with and to identify any changes that may have been made since the last successful build. This can help them to pinpoint the source of the error and to make any necessary changes to the code.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the larger zoo project, providing valuable information about the build of the project that can be used to ensure its stability and functionality.
