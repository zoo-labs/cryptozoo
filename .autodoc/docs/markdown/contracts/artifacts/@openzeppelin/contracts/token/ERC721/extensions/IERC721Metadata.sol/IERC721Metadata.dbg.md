This code is a JSON object that contains two key-value pairs. The first key is "_format" and its value is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The second key is "buildInfo" and its value is a file path to a JSON file located at "../../../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json". 

The purpose of this code is to provide information about the build and format of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which may be important for compatibility and versioning purposes. The "buildInfo" key provides a file path to a JSON file that likely contains more detailed information about the build, such as the version number, build date, and any dependencies used. 

This code may be used in the larger project to ensure that all components are using the same build and format, and to easily access information about the build. For example, if a developer needs to check the version number of the project, they can access the "buildInfo" file and retrieve that information. 

An example of how this code may be used in the larger project is in a build script. The build script may read the "_format" key to ensure that the build is in the correct format, and then use the "buildInfo" file to retrieve information about the build, such as the version number. This information can then be used to tag the build and deploy it to the appropriate environment. 

Overall, this code provides important information about the build and format of the project, which can be used to ensure consistency and compatibility across all components of the project.
