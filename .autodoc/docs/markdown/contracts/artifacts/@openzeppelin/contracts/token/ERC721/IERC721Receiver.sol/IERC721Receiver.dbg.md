This code is a JSON file that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the file, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to the location of the build information file, which is located at "../../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json". 

The purpose of this file is to provide information about the build of the project, which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. The build information file contains details about the version of the project, the build date, and other relevant information. 

In the larger project, this file may be used by developers and system administrators to identify the version of the project that is currently running, and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise. For example, if a bug is reported in the project, the build information file can be used to identify the version of the project that contains the bug, and to determine if the bug has been fixed in a later version. 

Here is an example of how this file may be used in the larger project:

```python
import json

# Load the build information file
with open('zoo/build-info.json', 'r') as f:
    build_info = json.load(f)

# Print the version of the project
print("Version: {}".format(build_info['version']))

# Print the build date
print("Build date: {}".format(build_info['buildDate']))
```

This code loads the build information file and prints the version of the project and the build date. This information can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.
