The code above is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the build, which in this case is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file that contains more detailed information about the build, such as the version number and the date of the build.

This code is important for the zoo project because it allows developers to keep track of the different builds of the project. By having a unique format for each build and a separate JSON file with detailed information, developers can easily identify and troubleshoot issues that may arise in different builds. For example, if a bug is discovered in a specific build, developers can quickly refer to the buildInfo file to determine which version of the code is affected and what changes were made in that build.

Here is an example of how this code may be used in the larger project:

```python
import json

with open('zoo/build_info.json') as f:
    build_info = json.load(f)

print(f"Build format: {build_info['_format']}")
print(f"Build info file: {build_info['buildInfo']}")
```

In this example, the code reads the buildInfo file and prints out the format and file path. This information can be used to identify the specific build of the project and troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the "_format" field?
   - The "_format" field is likely used to specify the format or version of the code or data contained within this file.

2. What does the "buildInfo" field refer to?
   - The "buildInfo" field likely refers to a JSON file containing information about the build process for this code, such as the version number or build date.

3. Why is the path to the buildInfo file so long and convoluted?
   - It's possible that the long path to the buildInfo file is due to the file being located in a specific directory structure required by the build process, or to ensure that the file is only accessible to authorized users.
