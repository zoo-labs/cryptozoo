[View code on GitHub](zoo-labs/zoo/blob/master/contracts/artifacts/@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC1155/IERC1155Receiver.sol/IERC1155Receiver.dbg.json)

This code is a configuration file for the zoo project. It contains two key-value pairs, "_format" and "buildInfo". The "_format" key specifies the format of the file, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key specifies the location of the build information file for the project, which is located at "../../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json".

The purpose of this configuration file is to provide important information about the project to other parts of the system. The "_format" key ensures that the file is in the correct format, which is important for the system to be able to read and use the file. The "buildInfo" key provides information about the build of the project, which can be used to track changes and ensure that the correct version of the project is being used.

This configuration file can be used in conjunction with other parts of the zoo project to ensure that the project is running correctly and using the correct version. For example, if the project is being built from source code, the build process can use the "buildInfo" key to ensure that the correct version of the project is being built. Similarly, other parts of the system can use the "_format" key to ensure that the configuration file is in the correct format before using it.

Overall, this configuration file plays an important role in the larger zoo project by providing key information about the project to other parts of the system. By ensuring that the project is using the correct version and format, this file helps to ensure that the project is running correctly and efficiently.
