This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key specifies the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key specifies the location of the build information file, which is located at "../../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json".

This code is important for tracking the build of the project and ensuring that the correct version is being used. It can be used in conjunction with other code to ensure that the correct build is being used in different environments, such as development, testing, and production.

For example, in a deployment script, this code could be used to check that the correct build is being deployed to the correct environment. If the build information does not match the expected values, the deployment could be halted to prevent errors or issues.

Overall, this code serves as a small but important piece of the larger project, helping to ensure that the correct build is being used and reducing the risk of errors or issues in different environments.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the "_format" field?
   - The "_format" field is likely used to specify the format or version of the code or data contained within this file.

2. What does the "buildInfo" field refer to?
   - The "buildInfo" field likely refers to a JSON file that contains information about the build process for this code, such as the version number or build date.

3. Why is the path to the buildInfo file so long and complex?
   - The long and complex path to the buildInfo file may be due to the file being located in a specific directory structure or build system that requires this specific path format. Alternatively, it may be a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to the buildInfo file.
