This code is a JSON file that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key indicates the format of the file, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key points to a JSON file located at "../../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json". 

The purpose of this code is to provide information about the build of the project. This information can be used to track changes and updates to the project, as well as to ensure that the project is running on the correct version of the build. 

For example, if a developer wants to check which version of the build is currently being used, they can access this JSON file and look at the "buildInfo" key to see the location of the build-info file. They can then open the build-info file to see more detailed information about the build, such as the date and time it was built, the version number, and any relevant notes or comments. 

Overall, this code serves as a small but important piece of the larger project, providing crucial information about the build that can be used by developers and other stakeholders to ensure the project is running smoothly and efficiently.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the "_format" field?
