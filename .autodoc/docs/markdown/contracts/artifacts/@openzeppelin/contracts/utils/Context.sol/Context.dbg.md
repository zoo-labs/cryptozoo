This code is a JSON object that contains information about the build of the project. The "_format" key specifies the format of the build, which is "hh-sol-dbg-1". The "buildInfo" key specifies the location of the build information file, which is located at "../../../../build-info/da771cde3295248bb0d9e49f712de35f.json".

This code is important for tracking the build of the project and ensuring that the correct version is being used. The build information file contains information about the build, such as the version number, build date, and build author. This information can be used to troubleshoot issues and ensure that the correct version of the project is being used.

An example of how this code may be used in the larger project is in a deployment script. The deployment script may use this code to verify that the correct version of the project is being deployed. If the version number in the build information file does not match the expected version number, the deployment script may fail and alert the user that the incorrect version is being deployed.

Overall, this code is a small but important part of the larger project. It provides information about the build of the project that can be used to ensure that the correct version is being used and troubleshoot issues.
