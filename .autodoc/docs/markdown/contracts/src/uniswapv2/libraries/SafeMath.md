The code above is a Solidity library called SafeMath that provides overflow-safe math functions for use in other contracts within the larger project. The library contains three functions: add, sub, and mul. 

The add function takes two unsigned integers as inputs and returns their sum. Before returning the result, the function checks if the sum is greater than or equal to the original value of x. If the sum is less than x, it means an overflow has occurred, and the function will revert with an error message.

The sub function takes two unsigned integers as inputs and returns their difference. Before returning the result, the function checks if the difference is less than or equal to the original value of x. If the difference is greater than x, it means an underflow has occurred, and the function will revert with an error message.

The mul function takes two unsigned integers as inputs and returns their product. Before returning the result, the function checks if the product is equal to x multiplied by y. If the product is not equal to x multiplied by y, it means an overflow has occurred, and the function will revert with an error message.

These functions are useful in preventing overflow and underflow errors that can occur when performing arithmetic operations on unsigned integers in Solidity. By using this library, developers can ensure that their contracts are more secure and less prone to errors. 

Here is an example of how the SafeMath library can be used in a contract:

```
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import "./SafeMath.sol";

contract MyContract {
    using SafeMath for uint256;

    uint256 public myNumber;

    function addNumber(uint256 _num) public {
        myNumber = myNumber.add(_num);
    }

    function subNumber(uint256 _num) public {
        myNumber = myNumber.sub(_num);
    }

    function mulNumber(uint256 _num) public {
        myNumber = myNumber.mul(_num);
    }
}
```

In this example, the MyContract contract imports the SafeMath library and uses the using keyword to make the SafeMath functions available to the contract. The addNumber, subNumber, and mulNumber functions all use the SafeMath functions to perform arithmetic operations on the myNumber variable. By using the SafeMath library, the contract is protected against overflow and underflow errors.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of the `SafeMath` library?
    
    The `SafeMath` library is used for performing overflow-safe math operations in Solidity contracts.

2. What version of Solidity is being used in this code?
    
    The code is using version 0.6.12 of Solidity.

3. What is the significance of the SPDX-License-Identifier comment?
    
    The SPDX-License-Identifier comment is used to specify the license under which the code is released. In this case, the code is released under the GPL-3.0 license.
