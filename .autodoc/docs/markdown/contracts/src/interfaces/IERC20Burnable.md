The code above defines an interface called `IERC20Burnable` which extends the `IERC20Mintable` interface. This interface specifies two functions: `burn` and `burnFrom`. 

The `burn` function takes in a parameter `_amount` which represents the amount of tokens to be burned. This function is used to remove tokens from circulation permanently. The `burnFrom` function takes in two parameters: `_from` and `_amount`. This function is used to remove tokens from a specific address `_from` and permanently remove them from circulation. 

This interface is useful in scenarios where a token needs to be removed from circulation, for example, if a token is no longer needed or if it is being replaced by a new token. By implementing this interface, developers can ensure that their token is burnable and can be removed from circulation when necessary. 

This interface is also useful in the context of the larger project because it allows other contracts to interact with the token and burn tokens when necessary. For example, a contract that manages a token swap or a token buyback program may need to burn tokens as part of the process. By implementing this interface, these contracts can interact with the token and burn tokens as needed. 

Here is an example of how this interface can be used in a contract:

```
import "./IERC20Burnable.sol";

contract TokenSwap {
    IERC20Burnable public token;

    constructor(address _tokenAddress) {
        token = IERC20Burnable(_tokenAddress);
    }

    function swapTokens(uint256 _amount) external {
        // do some logic to swap tokens
        token.burn(_amount);
    }
}
```

In the example above, the `TokenSwap` contract takes in an address of a burnable token and stores it in a public variable called `token`. The `swapTokens` function does some logic to swap tokens and then calls the `burn` function on the `token` contract to burn the swapped tokens.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and how does it fit into the overall zoo project?
- This code defines an interface called IERC20Burnable that extends the IERC20Mintable interface and adds two functions for burning tokens. It is likely part of the token functionality within the zoo project.

2. What version of Solidity is required for this code to compile?
- The code requires Solidity version 0.8.4 or higher, as specified in the pragma statement.

3. What is the relationship between the IERC20Burnable interface and the IERC20Mintable interface?
- The IERC20Burnable interface extends the IERC20Mintable interface, meaning that it includes all the functions from IERC20Mintable in addition to the two burn functions it defines. This suggests that burning tokens is a related but distinct functionality from minting tokens.
