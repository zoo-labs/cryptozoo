The code defines an interface for Zoo Protocol's Media, which is a smart contract that represents a piece of media (e.g. an image, video, or audio file) on the blockchain. The interface includes functions for minting new media, transferring ownership, setting and removing bids and asks, updating metadata, and revoking approval. 

The `MediaData` struct contains information about the media, including the URI of the content and metadata, as well as SHA256 hashes of the content and metadata. The `BidShares` struct contains information about the distribution of revenue from sales of the media, including the percentages that go to the creator, owner, and platform. 

The `EIP712Signature` struct is used for EIP-712 signature verification, which is a standard for secure signing of messages on the Ethereum blockchain. 

The `IMarket`, `IZoo`, and `IDrop` interfaces are imported from other smart contracts in the Zoo project. These interfaces define functions for buying, selling, and breeding digital assets, respectively. 

The `IMedia` interface is designed to be used by other smart contracts in the Zoo project, as well as by external developers who want to build applications that interact with Zoo Protocol's Media. For example, a developer could use the `mint` function to create a new piece of media and then use the `setAsk` function to put it up for sale on the marketplace. 

Overall, the `IMedia` interface is a crucial component of the Zoo project, as it enables the creation, ownership, and transfer of digital assets on the blockchain.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an interface for Zoo Protocol's Media, which includes functions for minting new media, setting and removing bids and asks, updating token URIs and metadata URIs, and more.

2. What other contracts does this code import and how are they used?
- This code imports several other contracts, including IERC721, IMarket, IZoo, and IDrop. These contracts are used to define various data structures and functions that are used within the IMedia interface.

3. What events are emitted by this code and what information do they provide?
- This code emits two events: TokenURIUpdated and TokenMetadataURIUpdated. These events provide information about when a token's URI or metadata URI has been updated, including the token ID, the owner of the token, and the new URI.
