This code defines an interface called IVoting that outlines the functions and data structures required for a voting system. The interface includes several structs, enums, and events that define the properties of a voting system. 

The Votes struct contains two uint256 variables that represent the number of approvals and disapprovals for a proposal. The VotingAmount struct contains two uint256 variables that represent the number of times a proposal has been approved or disapproved. The Voter struct contains information about a voter, including their address, the proposal they voted on, their vote choice, and the timestamp of their vote. 

The Status enum defines the possible states of a proposal, including Vote_now, soon, and Closed. The Type enum defines the type of proposal, either core or community. The Proposal struct contains information about a proposal, including the proposal text, whether it exists, the number of votes it has received, its type, status, start and end times, and the number of approvals and disapprovals it has received. 

The IVoting interface also includes several functions that can be used to interact with the voting system. The changeWithdrawAddress function allows the withdrawal address to be changed. The voteProposal function allows a user to vote on a proposal by passing in the proposal text and their vote choice. The isBlocked function checks if an address is blocked from voting. The blockAddress function can be used to block or unblock an address from voting. 

Overall, this code defines the structure and functionality of a voting system that can be used in a larger project. Developers can implement this interface in their own contracts to create a voting system that meets their specific needs. For example, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) could use this interface to allow its members to vote on proposals for the organization. 

Example usage:

```
contract MyDAO {
  IVoting public votingSystem;

  constructor(address _votingSystem) {
    votingSystem = IVoting(_votingSystem);
  }

  function createProposal(string memory _proposalText) public {
    // create a new proposal
    votingSystem.addedProposal(_proposalText, block.timestamp);
  }

  function voteOnProposal(string memory _proposalText, bool _voteChoice) public {
    // vote on a proposal
    votingSystem.voteProposal(_proposalText, _voteChoice);
  }
}
```
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code and what problem does it solve?
- This code defines an interface for a voting system that allows users to propose and vote on proposals. It solves the problem of decision-making in a decentralized manner.

2. What are the different types of proposals that can be made and what is the difference between them?
- There are two types of proposals: core and community. The difference between them is not clear from this code alone, but it is likely that core proposals are related to the core functionality of the system while community proposals are related to other aspects such as marketing or community events.

3. What events are emitted by this code and what information do they provide?
- Two events are emitted by this code: `addedProposal` and `votedProposal`. The `addedProposal` event provides the name of the new proposal and the timestamp when it was added. The `votedProposal` event provides the name of the proposal and the choice made by the voter (approve or disapprove).
