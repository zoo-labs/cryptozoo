This code defines an interface called `IRewarder` which is used to interact with a smart contract that rewards users with tokens for providing liquidity to a decentralized exchange. The interface includes two functions: `onTokensReward` and `pendingTokens`.

The `onTokensReward` function is called when a user is rewarded with tokens for providing liquidity to a specific pool identified by `pid`. The function takes in several parameters including the `user` who is being rewarded, the `recipient` of the tokens, the `tokenAmount` being rewarded, and the new liquidity pool (`newLpAmount`) after the reward has been given. This function is used to distribute tokens to users who have provided liquidity to the exchange and to update the liquidity pool accordingly.

The `pendingTokens` function is used to check the amount of tokens that a user is eligible to receive for providing liquidity to a specific pool. The function takes in the `pid` of the pool and the `user` address as parameters, as well as the `tokenAmount` that the user has provided. The function returns an array of `IERC20` tokens and their corresponding amounts that the user is eligible to receive as rewards.

This interface is important for the larger project as it allows for the distribution of rewards to users who provide liquidity to the exchange. By defining this interface, other smart contracts can interact with the reward system and distribute tokens accordingly. For example, a liquidity pool contract could call the `onTokensReward` function to distribute tokens to users who have provided liquidity to the pool. 

Overall, this code defines an important interface for the reward system in the zoo project, allowing for the distribution of tokens to users who provide liquidity to the exchange.
## Questions: 
 1. What is the purpose of this code?
- This code defines an interface called `IRewarder` which has two functions related to token rewards in a smart contract.

2. What is the `@zoolabs/solidity` package and where can it be found?
- The `@zoolabs/solidity` package is being imported in this code and it provides the `IERC20` interface. It is not clear from this code where the package can be found.

3. What are the parameters of the `onTokensReward` function and how are they used?
- The `onTokensReward` function takes in five parameters: `pid`, `user`, `recipient`, `tokenAmount`, and `newLpAmount`. It is not clear from this code how these parameters are used within the function.
